He rages at <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> for not foreseeing his defeat, despite her claims to see the future. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> insists that the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> only allows her glimpses and that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> cannot abandon the war because of a single defeat. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> accuses her of lying to him, of knowing nothing about war and angrily begins to strangle her.

They discover the dying <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> in the godswood.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daenerys in her vision of the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> room.  
Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> arrives at House of the <entidade:Undying>Undying</entidade> and is magically separated from Jorah and <entidade:Kovarro>Kovarro</entidade>. She finds herself in an empty circular room with many doors. She chooses one and opens it. She is presented with tempting visions. First the snowy, ruined throne room of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> where she turns away from the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. She then walks through the gates of the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> surrounded by more snow, and into <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>'s tent. She finds <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> and what would have been her infant son <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>. They talk about whose dream they are in, and Daenerys silently leaves after touching <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>'s hair. She returns to the room with many doors and finds her dragons chained to a pedestal in front of her. <entidade:Pyat <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pree</entidade>>Pyat <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pree</entidade></entidade> appears and explains that she and her brood are the source of his restored magic. Daenerys is also chained by Pyat's magic. The young queen is unconcerned however, and simply regards <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pree</entidade> with a cool, almost lazy gaze. She calmly utters a single word: "Dracarys"; after a couple of tries, all three dragons unleash their fiery breath, and <entidade:Pyat <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pree</entidade>>Pyat <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pree</entidade></entidade> is incinerated.
Daenerys knows that <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> has betrayed her. She returns to his palace to confront him and finds <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade> in bed with him. She takes his key and uses it to open his Valyrian stone vault. She is surprised when it is empty, but observes that this proves something can easily come from nothing. <entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> her orders, <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade> and <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> are locked into the empty vault to die, their pleas cut off by the closing door. Daenerys salvages enough from <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade>'s household to buy a ship. <entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> Jorah's orders, the Dothraki seize <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade>'s gold and jewels while Daenerys triumphantly watches with her three dragons.

<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>
    The King-<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade>-the-<entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>'s <entidade:Lannister Camp>Camp</entidade>.  
<entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> and <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin Halfhand</entidade> are marched towards the camp of the King-<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade>-the-<entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>, as captives of the Lord of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade>. Qhorin realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings, so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword, attacking Jon with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery. The Lord of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade> lets them fight, and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> gives Jon back his sword. Qhorin enrages Jon by insulting his parentage. After a fierce duel, Jon mortally wounds Qhorin per Qhorin's own instructions, who whispers to Jon "We are the watchers on the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>" before he breathes his last, signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding Jon that he must find out all he can about the wildlings' plans and get back to the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>. By killing Qhorin, the wildlings believe Jon has betrayed his oath and release him. Impressed, the Lord of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade> cuts Jon free. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> shows him their vast army, gathering in a valley below. She promises to take him to their King and, with no other choice, Jon follows her.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade> of the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade>, Sam, <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> and Edd are foraging for fuel when they hear three horn blasts; the warning call for <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>. The three run back to the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade>. Sam is left behind, caught in a sudden blizzard. Seeing shadowy figures moving through the blowing snow, Sam hides behind a rock and watches as dozens of Wights walk past him, led by a White Walker riding an undead horse-wight. Sam cowers in fear, but the White Walker seemingly ignores him. Raising a spear with a blade of ice, the creature gives a piercing shriek, and the army of wights and <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, numbering several hundred, advances on the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade>.
