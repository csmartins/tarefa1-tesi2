Following his defeat at the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon has retreated back to <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>. He rages at <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> for not foreseeing his defeat, despite her claims to see the future. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> insists that the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> only allows her glimpses and that <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> cannot abandon the war because of a single defeat. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> accuses her of lying to him, of knowing nothing about war and angrily begins to strangle her. When <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> insists her god is in him, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> releases her, realizing she is talking about the creature they created to murder his brother. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> tells <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> he will betray his men, his family and his beliefs but in the end, it will be worth it; she assures <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> that he is the Lord's Chosen and he will be king. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> is skeptical, but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> has him look into a brazier; <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> appears to have visions, restoring his faith in the Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>.

When the men return, the pair try to lie their way out of the situation. Jaime is recognized and <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> chose to kill the soldiers. In so doing she reveals her prowess as a fighter to Jaime.

In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> is besieged by a northern army under command of Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>'s bastard son. <entidade:Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>>Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade></entidade> tells Theon his chances of holding the castle with only twenty men are negligible. <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade> suggests that Theon join the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, gaining a chance to redeem himself. When Theon refuses (fearing that <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> will kill him for his betrayal) and tries to rally his men for battle, they betray him; <entidade:Dagmer Cleftjaw>Dagmer</entidade> knocks Theon out.

They discover the dying <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade> in the godswood.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daenerys in her vision of the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> room.  
<entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> arrives at House of the <entidade:Undying>Undying</entidade> and is magically separated from Jorah and <entidade:Kovarro>Kovarro</entidade>. She finds herself in an empty circular room with many doors. She chooses one and opens it. She is presented with tempting visions. <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> the snowy, ruined throne room of <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> where she turns away from the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. She then walks through the gates of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> surrounded by more snow, and into <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> tent. She finds Drogo and what would have been her infant son <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>. They talk about whose dream they are in, and Daenerys silently leaves after touching <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>'s hair. She returns to the room with many doors and finds her dragons chained to a pedestal in front of her. <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pyat Pree</entidade> appears and explains that she and her brood are the source of his restored magic. Daenerys is also chained by Pyat's magic. The young queen is unconcerned however, and simply regards Pree with a cool, almost lazy gaze. She calmly utters a single word: "<entidade:Dracarys>Dracarys</entidade>"; after a couple of tries, all three dragons unleash their fiery breath, and <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pyat Pree</entidade> is incinerated.
Daenerys knows that <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> has betrayed her. She returns to his palace to confront him and finds <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade> in bed with him. She takes his key and uses it to open his Valyrian stone vault. She is surprised when it is empty, but observes that this proves something can easily come from nothing. On her orders, <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade> and <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> are locked into the empty vault to die, their pleas cut off by the closing door. Daenerys salvages enough from <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade>'s household to buy a ship. On Jorah's orders, the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> seize <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade>'s gold and jewels while Daenerys triumphantly watches with her three dragons.

<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    The <entidade:King-<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade>-the-<entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>>King-<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade>-the-<entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade></entidade>'s Camp.  
<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin Halfhand</entidade> are marched towards the camp of the <entidade:King-<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade>-the-<entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>>King-<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade>-the-<entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>, as captives of the <entidade:Lord of Bones>Lord of Bones</entidade>. Qhorin realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings, so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword, attacking Jon with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery. The <entidade:Lord of Bones>Lord of Bones</entidade> lets them fight, and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> gives Jon back his sword. Qhorin enrages Jon by insulting his parentage. After a fierce duel, Jon mortally wounds Qhorin per Qhorin's own instructions, who whispers to Jon "We are the watchers on the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>" before he breathes his last, signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding Jon that he must find out all he can about the wildlings' plans and get back to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. By killing Qhorin, the wildlings believe Jon has betrayed his oath and release him. Impressed, the <entidade:Lord of Bones>Lord of Bones</entidade> cuts Jon free. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> shows him their vast army, gathering in a valley below. She promises to take him to their King and, with no other choice, Jon follows her.
At the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade> of the <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade>, Sam, <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> and Edd are foraging for fuel when they hear three horn blasts; the warning call for <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers. The three run back to the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade>. Sam is left behind, caught in a sudden blizzard. Seeing shadowy figures moving through the blowing snow, Sam hides behind a rock and watches as dozens of <entidade:Wights>Wights</entidade> walk past him, led by a <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker riding an undead horse-wight. Sam cowers in fear, but the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker seemingly ignores him. Raising a spear with a blade of ice, the creature gives a piercing shriek, and the army of wights and <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers, numbering several hundred, advances on the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade>.
