Jaime meets a relative; Theon hunts; <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> receives an invitation.


In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
At <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, now held by the ironborn, <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> awakens to find that <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> is gone and she has escaped with Hodor, <entidade:<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark><entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark</entidade> and their direwolves. Theon berates <entidade:Lorren>Lorren</entidade> for allowing them to escape. When <entidade:Lorren>Lorren</entidade> counters that Theon is also to blame for sleeping with <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> and letting his guard down, Theon furiously beats him. Theon leads the ironborn on horse to hunt down the boys with hounds to track them. The search leads them to a shepherd's farm, but the farmer says that he hasn't seen anyone. <entidade:Dagmer Cleftjaw>Dagmer</entidade> finds some walnut shells, so they know that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> were there, but the hounds can't get the scent. Theon tells them the hunt is over and to return <entidade:Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>>Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade></entidade> to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>: he knows where they are, and his mercy has been exhausted.

    Theon has the burned bodies raised on the walls of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>  
Theon returns to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> with two children's bodies burned beyond recognition, and he has them hoisted to either side of the main gate. <entidade:Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>>Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade></entidade> cries out in grief when he sees them.
At <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> is discussing the assassination of <entidade:Amory Lorch>Amory Lorch</entidade> with Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> is convinced that it was an assassination attempt on himself, unaware that <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade> actually killed Lorch on the request of <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Ser Gregor>Ser Gregor</entidade> speculates that the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> Without Banners may have been responsible. <entidade:Enraged>Enraged</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> orders Gregor to burn out villages and farms in reprisal for this assassination attempt. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> later suspects that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is highborn, because she doesn't pronounce "<entidade:M'Lord>M'Lord</entidade>" the way commoners do, instead saying "My Lord," and possesses an educated vocabulary. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> makes the excuse that her <entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade>, whom she said was a handmaiden for years to royalty, had taught her to speak properly like them.
In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> comes to thank Sandor "The <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>" Clegane for saving her life during the recent riot in the city and says that he was very brave. Sandor simply says that a dog doesn't need courage to fight off rats. Sansa is perturbed by his "hateful speech," but Sandor cautions that a day will come when his penchant for violence is all that stands between her and her "beloved" <entidade:King Joffrey>King Joffrey</entidade>.

    Sansa and <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> trying to flip the mattress.  
Sansa awakens in her bed from a nightmare, only to find the sheets covered in blood–she has begun menstruating for the first time. Given that Joffrey openly promised to rape Sansa to "put a son in you" as soon as she had her blood, she then frantically tries to get rid of the bloody sheets to remove the evidence. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> tries to help Sansa hide the sheets but Sandor finds them.
<entidade:Terrified>Terrified</entidade> of being brought to Joffrey, Sansa is instead brought before <entidade:Queen Cersei><entidade:Queen <entidade:Queen Regent>Regent</entidade>>Queen <entidade:Queen Regent>Regent</entidade></entidade> Cersei</entidade> Lannister, who awkwardly tries to comfort her. Cersei presents Sansa with warped advice on Joffrey, bizarre counseling based on her bitter marriage with <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> Baratheon. Blithely waving away her son's torment of Sansa and homicidal outbursts she says that her brother <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> stayed by her side the whole time she was giving birth to Joffrey, but Sansa should never expect such devotion from Joffrey. Cersei firmly believes that Sansa and Joffrey not being in love is a good thing; she advises Sansa "the more people you love, the weaker you are." Cersei says that no one expects her to love Joffrey, though she may take comfort in her love for the children they will have.
Privately, Cersei meets with <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and expresses regret at having children with her own brother Jaime. She wonders if Joffrey's violent personality is the price of her and Jaime's sins. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> earnestly points out that her other two children, Myrcella and Tommen, are not monsters, and they share an odd moment of sympathy.

    <entidade:Torrhen Karstark>Torrhen</entidade> <entidade:Harald Karstark>Karstark</entidade> discovers the body of <entidade:<entidade:Alton Lannister>Alton</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Alton Lannister>Alton</entidade> Lannister</entidade>.  
At King <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s army camp in the <entidade:Westerlands>Westerlands</entidade>, close to an unidentified keep, <entidade:<entidade:Alton Lannister>Alton</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Alton Lannister>Alton</entidade> Lannister</entidade> returns as an envoy giving <entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade>'s response to Robb's peace terms. Robb is unsurprised that she rejected them and imprisons <entidade:Alton Lannister>Alton</entidade> with his cousin <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>. The nurse <entidade:Queen Talisa>Talisa</entidade> Maegyr discusses medical supplies she needs with Robb. Robb suggests she accompany him to the <entidade:Crag>Crag</entidade> to acquire the supplies she needs. That night, Jaime kills <entidade:Alton Lannister>Alton</entidade> to lure the guard, <entidade:Torrhen Karstark>Torrhen</entidade> <entidade:Harald Karstark>Karstark</entidade>, into his cell. Jaime strangles <entidade:Torrhen Karstark>Torrhen</entidade> and escapes, but is soon recaptured. <entidade:Torrhen Karstark>Torrhen</entidade> was the son of <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Rickard>Rickard</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Rickard>Rickard</entidade></entidade> <entidade:Harald Karstark>Karstark</entidade>, one of the major nobles from the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Rickard>Rickard</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Rickard>Rickard</entidade></entidade> demands Jaime's execution in revenge, regardless of his protected status as both a prisoner of war and a valuable political hostage. Catelyn is forced to argue for Jaime's life. Catelyn confronts Jaime and tells him that he has no honor. Jaime bitterly explains that his vows as a knight required him to defend the innocent and serve the king, but his king was slaughtering the innocent. Jaime considers concepts like "honor" and "loyalty" naïve at best and hypocritical at worst. Jaime asserts that he has only been with Cersei and begins to ridicule <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade>, Catelyn's late husband, by bringing up the shame of Eddard fathering a bastard. This brings Catelyn to breaking point and she asks for <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>'s sword.

<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> is still separated from the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> scouting group led by <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin Halfhand</entidade>. He attempts to locate them, traveling with his wildling prisoner <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>. She argues with Jon, criticizing him for ignoring their common descent from the <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade>. She states that the animosity of the southerners to the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> is arbitrary, given that the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> are only distinguished from them by living north of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> when it was constructed. She mocks Jon's sexual repression and surmises that he is a virgin. She taunts him by offering to teach him how to have sex. She escapes and leads him into an ambush. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> says that Jon should have taken her when he had the chance.

In <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>
<entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> is desperate to find her stolen dragons. <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> returns and she orders him to find them. <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> <entidade:Xhoan Daxos>Xhoan Daxos</entidade> claims to be distressed at breaking his promise to protect her, fearing that his word will be publicly seen as worthless. Jorah questions <entidade:Quaithe>Quaithe</entidade> of Asshai. <entidade:Quaithe>Quaithe</entidade> knows that Jorah once betrayed Daenerys by spying on her. <entidade:Quaithe>Quaithe</entidade> warns Jorah that the man who stole the dragons is already with Daenerys. Jorah finds Daenerys, in the company of <entidade:Kovarro>Kovarro</entidade>, pleading with the council of The <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade> to find her dragons. The warlock <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pyat Pree</entidade> confesses to stealing the dragons and declares <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> the King of <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>. Doubles of the warlock then magically appear behind the other members of the <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade> and slit their throats, leaving only <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pyat Pree</entidade> and <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade>. <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> secretly entered into an alliance with <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pyat Pree</entidade> to become king. <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pyat Pree</entidade> urges Daenerys to find her dragons at the House of the <entidade:Undying>Undying</entidade> as the three flee.
