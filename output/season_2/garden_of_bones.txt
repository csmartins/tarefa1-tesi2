<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> attempts to restrain Joffrey's cruelty. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> attempts to broker a peace between <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> and her followers arrive at the great city of <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade> and hope to find refuge there. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> arrive at <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, a great castle now under <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> occupation.


<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
    A <entidade:Silent Sisters>Silent Sister</entidade> working on a casualty at <entidade:Battle Oxcross>Oxcross</entidade>.  
The <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> army under <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> leads a surprise night-time assault against an encamped <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> army, which was only manned by Rennick and another <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> guardsman (Garden of Bones), with his direwolf <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade> causing a considerable amount of damage. The <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of <entidade:Battle Oxcross>Oxcross</entidade> is a smashing victory, following through on Robb's promise to give <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> "another <entidade:Whispering Wood>Whispering Wood</entidade>." [2] The next day <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> surveys the battlefield as <entidade:Silent Sisters>Silent Sisters</entidade> tend to both <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> and <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> wounded, while his bannerman, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> of the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>, argues that they should kill all of the <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> soldiers they took prisoner, because they're having trouble supplying their own army and prisoners will slow them down. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> disagrees, saying they will fight honorably and follow the laws of war. <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> concedes that some of the <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> officers might have useful information they could be tortured into revealing, but <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> refuses, not wanting to give the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> an excuse to torture his sisters, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>.
<entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> sees a woman battlefield healer treating a wounded <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> soldier. The prisoner protests when she tells him she has to amputate in order to save his life. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> helps hold him down as she saws off the leg. The woman, who introduces herself as <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade> of <entidade:Bridge Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, criticizes <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> for the need for this war. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> doesn't want the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, just revenge on <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> for his father's death. She is shocked to learn he doesn't care which king takes the throne after they defeat <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> (having declared for neither of the <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> brothers). He just wants them to leave the north alone afterward. She points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused, he hasn't hurt the ones who killed his father, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade>. The men they slaughtered were not Tywin's main army but unwilling boy soldiers and conscripts from the <entidade:Westerlands>Westerlands</entidade>.

    The prisoners arrive at <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>.  
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>, and <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade> are taken by Ser <entidade:Amory Lorch>Amory</entidade> Lorch's group of soldiers to <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, a vast but partially ruined castle which was badly damaged during the <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen Conquest</entidade> three hundred years ago by dragons' fire. Arya's group is herded in with many other prisoners the <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> soldiers have taken, primarily peasant refugees from the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. The commander of the entire <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> force is Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Clegane</entidade>, "the <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade> That Rides," previously declared an outlaw by <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> for his raiding in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. Now the positions are reversed, with <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Clegane</entidade> having the support of the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> to brutalize the <entidade:Rivermen>Rivermen</entidade>. The stench of corpses is so strong that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> notices it as soon as they are in sight of the castle. The <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> soldiers under Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> - particularly one known as The Tickler–sadistically torture many of the prisoners they have taken. One method used is to tie a bucket containing a rat to a man's abdomen, and then to hold a flame to the back of the bucket so the rat will chew its way through the man's guts. The prisoners are for the most part simple peasant refugees with no knowledge of the war, and the <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> soldiers are savagely torturing them just because they want to know where they may have hid the few valuables they have. However, some are also asked if they know anything about a group known as "The <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade>." Just as <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> is about to be tortured, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> arrives with the main host of his army, who have retreated to <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> to regroup after their loss at the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Whispering Wood>Whispering Wood</entidade>. The main <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> army group led by <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is settling in to use <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> as their new main base for the ongoing campaign in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>.

    "Leave her face, I like her pretty."  
<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> orders an immediate halt to the tortures (saving Gendry), rationally pointing out how disproportionate it is relative to what little wealth the peasants might be hiding, and it would be far more efficient to put them to work around the castle. As a blacksmith's apprentice, Gendry's skills are of particular use to them, and he is set to work. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> instantly notices that "Arry" is really a girl dressed up in boy's clothing, criticizing his soldiers for being too foolish to notice. When he asks her why she's dressed as a boy, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> simply explains that it was safer. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is impressed with her intelligence, and takes her on as his new cupbearer while his army is based at the castle.
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade> is furious when he hears of <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> Stark's decisive victory against <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> forces. He has <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> brought before the assembled court in the recently redecorated throne room, which now boasts iron spikes on many surfaces and roaring fires surrounding the pillars. <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> tells <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and the assembled nobles that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> only won the battle with trickery and sorcery. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> first, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> sadistically menaces <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> by brandishing a crossbow at her and openly toying with the thought of killing her right in front of the throne to send her brother a message. Despite being clearly terrified, Sansa refuses to give <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> the satisfaction of scaring her and continues to firmly pledge her loyalty. <entidade:Annoyed>Annoyed</entidade>, he reluctantly concedes to his mother's insistence that they need <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> alive, lowering the crossbow and ordering her to stand. 

    <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, beaten and stripped in front of the entire court.  
<entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> then sits down on the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> and commands Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> to beat and strip her as punishment, but instructs <entidade:Meryn Trant>Trant</entidade> to leave her face because "I like her pretty." Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> punches Sansa violently in the stomach and strikes her in the back of the legs with the flat of his sword, causing her to fall down. He then rips open the back of her gown, leaving her partially naked from the waist up. As the beating continues, the entire court watches in horror, particularly a disgusted Sandor <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Clegane</entidade>. But despite being filled with dozens of knights and officials, no one intervenes out of fear of Joffrey's wrath.
A furious <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> marches in and puts a stop to the spectacle. He orders someone to cover <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> up and <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> immediately steps forward, taking off his cloak and proceeds to gently wrap it around her. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> turns his wrath upon <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>, berating his actions as <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming (and the fact that Joffrey doesn't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp). Furious, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> proclaims that he was punishing her. Denouncing his nephew as a "halfwit," <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> points out the absurdity of punishing <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> for her brother's actions miles away in a war that <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> himself started. Now completely enraged, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> bellows that as king, he can do whatever he pleases, but <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> again coldly counters that the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> thought he could do as he pleased too, which led to him being overthrown and killed.

    <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> torments <entidade:Roslin Frey>Ros</entidade> to send a message to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>.  
When Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> tries to support the king, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> silences the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> by ordering <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> to kill <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> if the knight opens his mouth again. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> comforts the shaken <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and personally escorts her out of the hall. He asks her whether she wants to end her engagement to the king, but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and will uphold her duty. Impressed, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> remarks that she has learned how to survive around <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and might just make it out of her situation alive, respectfully calling her "Lady <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>."
<entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> suggests to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that as an angry young man, maybe what <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> needs is to have sex with a woman, and that they should set him up with a prostitute. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> agrees that maybe this would give <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> a chance to release his frustrations away from <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>. Indeed, he might even be grateful for the gesture: given that he didn't have much of a father figure in <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> to set him straight, doing something nice for the boy might even be the second chance <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> needs to re-establish a relationship with a male family figure. So <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> arranges for two prostitutes from Littlefinger's brothel, <entidade:Roslin Frey>Ros</entidade> and <entidade:Daisy>Daisy</entidade>, to entertain <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>. Unfortunately, the attempt fails horrifically: instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> crossbow-point, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> forces <entidade:Roslin Frey>Ros</entidade> to beat <entidade:Daisy>Daisy</entidade> unconscious, and then to dump her body in Tyrion's chambers, to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> again.
As <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> works in his chamber late at night, his cousin <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> knocks on his door delivering orders from <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> to release Grand <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> from the dungeon at once. Despite their blood relationship <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> clearly holds <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> in contempt and openly calls him "Imp." Curious, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> asks why <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> is so late delivering the message. Blundering into a rather obvious trap, <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is never late. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> then simply points out how odd it is that <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> would be coming from Cersei's bedchambers in the middle of the night. <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> nervously says <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> often works tirelessly keeping late hours, but <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> also notices that he reeks of Cersei's favorite lavender oil perfume. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> enquires whether <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> was made a knight before or after he started sharing Cersei's bed. <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> falls apart, saying that Cersei's father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically asks if <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> forced him to have sex with her too. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> wonders aloud what <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> would do if he found out that <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> had not only killed Joffrey's father but was also sleeping with his mother. <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> gets down on his knees and pleads for his life. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> gently instructs <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> that he won't tell, but from now on, <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> must report everything <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> does back to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. As <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> leaves, he also casually agrees that he will accede to Cersei's request and free <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> if she wants him as a "pet", though he doesn't want him back on the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade>.
<entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr</entidade> "Littlefinger" <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> arrives at <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> Baratheon's camp as a political envoy from <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade> at King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. He tries to gain Renly's trust by implying that if <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> does march on the capital, he will help take down the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> from within (it is unclear if he is lying, but he is also ready to jump ship if the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> lose, and <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is not an option, because <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> despises Littlefinger); <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> is tempted by the notion, despite his dislike for <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> then has a conversation with <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> in which he tries to intimidate her by hinting that her husband is homosexual. He does not anticipate that Margaery seems to already know and not to care. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> is not a naive ingenue like <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> but versed in court strategies: she honestly believes that <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> is the best candidate for king, and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> and <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade>. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> then meets with <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, who is still furious at his betrayal of her husband to his death. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> first tries to kindle a romance with her, saying that now they are both free, it may be that they can be together. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> simply draws a dagger and demands that he stop speaking. Discouraged, he moves on to present Tyrion's offer that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> want to make a prisoner exchange with the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>: if they release <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> will release both <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> (Baelish lies about the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> having Arya). <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> insists that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> would never allow the exchange, but <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters. As a show of good faith from <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> brings forward a pair of <entidade:Silent Sisters>Silent Sisters</entidade> carrying a box containing the remains of <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>. Deeply grieving, <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> tells <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr</entidade> to get out. She looks at the bones with pain, but then shuts the box with a look of resolve on her face.

    The shadow wrenches itself free from Melisandre's womb.  
<entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> then arrives at Renly's camp, along with the <entidade:Red Priestess>Red Priestess</entidade> <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> in his retinue. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> has come to treat with <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> and give him the chance to willingly relinquish his claim and serve his older brother. <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>, along with his <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> members <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade>, counters that no one wants <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> to be king. <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> also scoffs at Stannis' conversion to the religion of the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> criticizes both brothers for acting like sulking children. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> counters that it is odd that <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> is standing alongside <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>, given that her own husband <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> rejected Renly's initial plan to claim the throne and supported <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> as Robert's rightful heir, even at the cost of his own life. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> offers <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> that if he relinquishes his claim, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> will grant him his old seat on the small council, and even name him as his heir (unless <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> ever has a son in the future). <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> reminds <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> that their common enemy is the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, but he will not hear it, again asserting his right to the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> states that the 100,000 soldiers waving his banners makes him king, and Stannis' small army is hopelessly outnumbered. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> says that they shall see the next morning when their armies clash, and he departs. As she leaves <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> warns, "Look to your sins <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>, for the night is dark and full of terrors." <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> watches his brother fade into the distance and asks his companions if they can believe that he loved <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> once.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> Stannis' command, Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> rows <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> to some caves located near Renly's camp. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> knows these caves from his old smuggling days. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> asks him about whether he desires her, and his views on the conflict they are involved in between right and wrong, insisting that she is on the side of good. They find the way through the caves is blocked by metal bars. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> takes off her cloak revealing that she is naked and heavily pregnant and promptly "gives birth" to a creature made entirely of shadow, as Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> looks on in horror.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    The main gate of <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade> opens for <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>.  
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> the return of her bloodrider <entidade:Kovarro>Kovarro</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> receives word that the city of <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade> is nearby, and they are willing to receive the "Mother of Dragons." Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> cautions that the desert surrounding <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade> is known as the "Garden of Bones," as those who are turned away by <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade> perish outside the city walls due to exposure and thirst. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> and her Khalasar leave the <entidade:Red Waste>Red Waste</entidade> and reach the city of <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade>. The <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade>, a group of wealthy nobles and merchant princes, the leaders of <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade>, emerge to greet her, guarded by a group of shielded spearmen. One of the <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade>, the Spice <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>, speaks for the group. They request that the "Mother of Dragons" present her children, but <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> insists that her people be fed and sheltered before she reveals her dragons. The <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade> decide to turn Daenerys' group away and abandon them to the Garden of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade>. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> swears vengeance on <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade>, with "fire and blood," should they not comply. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> seems to find these threats rather reckless, but one of the <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade>, <entidade:Xaro Xhoan Daxos>Xaro Xhoan Daxos</entidade>, chooses to vouch for <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> through <entidade:Sumai>Sumai</entidade>, a blood oath by which a <entidade:Qartheen>Qartheen</entidade> may vouch for a visitor. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> and her Khalasar are let into <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade>.
