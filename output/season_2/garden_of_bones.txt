<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> attempts to restrain Joffrey's cruelty. Catelyn attempts to broker a peace between <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> and Renly. Daenerys and her followers arrive at the great city of <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade> and hope to find refuge there. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> arrive at <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, a great castle now under Lannister occupation.


In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
    A Silent Sister working on a casualty at <entidade:Oxcross>Oxcross</entidade>.  
The Northern army under King <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade> leads a surprise night-time assault against an encamped Lannister army, which was only manned by <entidade:Rennick>Rennick</entidade> and another Lannister guardsman (<entidade:Garden of Bones>Garden of Bones</entidade>), with his direwolf <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade> causing a considerable amount of damage. The <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of <entidade:Oxcross>Oxcross</entidade> is a smashing victory, following through on Robb's promise to give Cersei "another <entidade:Whispering Wood>Whispering Wood</entidade>." [2] The next day Robb surveys the battlefield as <entidade:Silent Sisters>Silent Sisters</entidade> tend to both Stark and Lannister wounded, while his bannerman, Lord Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> of the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>, argues that they should kill all of the Lannister soldiers they took prisoner, because they're having trouble supplying their own army and prisoners will slow them down. Robb disagrees, saying they will fight honorably and follow the laws of war. <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> concedes that some of the Lannister officers might have useful information they could be tortured into revealing, but Robb refuses, not wanting to give the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> an excuse to torture his sisters, Sansa and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>.
Robb sees a woman battlefield healer treating a wounded Lannister soldier. The prisoner protests when she tells him she has to amputate in order to save his life. Robb helps hold him down as she saws off the leg. The woman, who introduces herself as <entidade:Queen Talisa>Talisa</entidade> of <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, criticizes Robb for the need for this war. Robb doesn't want the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>, just revenge on Joffrey for his father's death. She is shocked to learn he doesn't care which king takes the throne after they defeat Joffrey (having declared for neither of the Baratheon brothers). He just wants them to leave the north alone afterward. She points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused, he hasn't hurt the ones who killed his father, Joffrey and <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>. The men they slaughtered were not <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>'s main army but unwilling boy soldiers and conscripts from the <entidade:Westerlands>Westerlands</entidade>.

    The prisoners arrive at <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>.  
<entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade>, <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>, and <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade> are taken by Ser <entidade:Amory Lorch>Amory Lorch</entidade>'s group of soldiers to <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, a vast but partially ruined castle which was badly damaged during the <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen Conquest</entidade> three hundred years ago by dragons' fire. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s group is herded in with many other prisoners the Lannister soldiers have taken, primarily peasant refugees from the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. The commander of the entire Lannister force is Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, "the <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade> That <entidade:Rides>Rides</entidade>," previously declared an outlaw by <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> for his raiding in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. Now the positions are reversed, with Clegane having the support of the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> to brutalize the <entidade:Rivermen>Rivermen</entidade>. The stench of corpses is so strong that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> notices it as soon as they are in sight of the castle. The Lannister soldiers under <entidade:Ser Gregor>Ser Gregor</entidade> - particularly one known as The <entidade:<entidade:Tickler>Tickler</entidade>–sadistically><entidade:Tickler>Tickler</entidade>–sadistically</entidade> torture many of the prisoners they have taken. <entidade:One>One</entidade> method used is to tie a bucket containing a rat to a man's abdomen, and then to hold a flame to the back of the bucket so the rat will chew its way through the man's guts. The prisoners are for the most part simple peasant refugees with no knowledge of the war, and the Lannister soldiers are savagely torturing them just because they want to know where they may have hid the few valuables they have. However, some are also asked if they know anything about a group known as "The <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade>." Just as <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> is about to be tortured, Lord <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> arrives with the main host of his army, who have retreated to <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> to regroup after their loss at the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Whispering Wood>Whispering Wood</entidade>. The main Lannister army group led by <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade></entidade> is settling in to use <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> as their new main base for the ongoing campaign in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>.

    "Leave her face, I like her pretty."  
<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> orders an immediate halt to the tortures (saving <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>), rationally pointing out how disproportionate it is relative to what little wealth the peasants might be hiding, and it would be far more efficient to put them to work around the castle. As a blacksmith's apprentice, <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>'s skills are of particular use to them, and he is set to work. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> instantly notices that "Arry" is really a girl dressed up in boy's clothing, criticizing his soldiers for being too foolish to notice. When he asks her why she's dressed as a boy, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> simply explains that it was safer. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> is impressed with her intelligence, and takes her on as his new cupbearer while his army is based at the castle.
In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, King <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade> is furious when he hears of <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s decisive victory against Lannister forces. He has <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> brought before the assembled court in the recently redecorated throne room, which now boasts iron spikes on many surfaces and roaring fires surrounding the pillars. <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade> tells Sansa and the assembled nobles that Robb only won the battle with trickery and sorcery. At first, Joffrey sadistically menaces Sansa by brandishing a crossbow at her and openly toying with the thought of killing her right in front of the throne to send her brother a message. Despite being clearly terrified, Sansa refuses to give Joffrey the satisfaction of scaring her and continues to firmly pledge her loyalty. <entidade:Annoyed>Annoyed</entidade>, he reluctantly concedes to his mother's insistence that they need Sansa alive, lowering the crossbow and ordering her to stand. 

    Sansa, beaten and stripped in front of the entire court.  
Joffrey then sits down on the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> and commands <entidade:Ser Meryn>Ser Meryn</entidade> Trant of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> to beat and strip her as punishment, but instructs Trant to leave her face because "I like her pretty." <entidade:Ser Meryn>Ser Meryn</entidade> punches Sansa violently in the stomach and strikes her in the back of the legs with the flat of his sword, causing her to fall down. He then rips open the back of her gown, leaving her partially naked from the waist up. As the beating continues, the entire court watches in horror, particularly a disgusted <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade>. But despite being filled with dozens of knights and officials, no one intervenes out of fear of Joffrey's wrath.
A furious <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> marches in and puts a stop to the spectacle. He orders someone to cover Sansa up and Sandor immediately steps forward, taking off his cloak and proceeds to gently wrap it around her. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> turns his wrath upon Joffrey, berating his actions as Sansa is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming (and the fact that Joffrey doesn't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp). <entidade:Furious>Furious</entidade>, Joffrey proclaims that he was punishing her. Denouncing his nephew as a "halfwit," <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> points out the absurdity of punishing Sansa for her brother's actions miles away in a war that Joffrey himself started. Now completely enraged, Joffrey bellows that as king, he can do whatever he pleases, but <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> again coldly counters that the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade> thought he could do as he pleased too, which led to him being overthrown and killed.

    Joffrey torments Ros to send a message to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>.  
When <entidade:Ser Meryn>Ser Meryn</entidade> tries to support the king, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> silences the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> by ordering <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> to kill Meryn if the knight opens his mouth again. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> comforts the shaken Sansa and personally escorts her out of the hall. He asks her whether she wants to end her engagement to the king, but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves Joffrey and will uphold her duty. Impressed, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> remarks that she has learned how to survive around Joffrey and might just make it out of her situation alive, respectfully calling her "<entidade:Lady Stark>Lady Stark</entidade>."
<entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> suggests to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that as an angry young man, maybe what Joffrey needs is to have sex with a woman, and that they should set him up with a prostitute. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> agrees that maybe this would give Joffrey a chance to release his frustrations away from Sansa. Indeed, he might even be grateful for the gesture: given that he didn't have much of a father figure in <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> to set him straight, doing something nice for the boy might even be the second chance Joffrey needs to re-establish a relationship with a male family figure. So <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> arranges for two prostitutes from <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s brothel, Ros and <entidade:Daisy>Daisy</entidade>, to entertain Joffrey. Unfortunately, the attempt fails horrifically: instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes, Joffrey brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber. At crossbow-point, Joffrey forces Ros to beat <entidade:Daisy>Daisy</entidade> unconscious, and then to dump her body in <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s chambers, to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of Sansa again.
As <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> works in his chamber late at night, his cousin <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade> knocks on his door delivering orders from Cersei to release Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> from the dungeon at once. Despite their blood relationship Lancel clearly holds <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> in contempt and openly calls him "<entidade:Imp>Imp</entidade>." <entidade:Curious>Curious</entidade>, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> asks why Lancel is so late delivering the message. Blundering into a rather obvious trap, Lancel retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is never late. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> then simply points out how odd it is that Lancel would be coming from Cersei's bedchambers in the middle of the night. Lancel nervously says Cersei often works tirelessly keeping late hours, but <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> also notices that he reeks of Cersei's favorite lavender oil perfume. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> enquires whether Lancel was made a knight before or after he started sharing Cersei's bed. Lancel falls apart, saying that Cersei's father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically asks if Cersei forced him to have sex with her too. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> wonders aloud what Joffrey would do if he found out that Lancel had not only killed Joffrey's father but was also sleeping with his mother. Lancel gets down on his knees and pleads for his life. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> gently instructs Lancel that he won't tell, but from now on, Lancel must report everything Cersei does back to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>. As Lancel leaves, he also casually agrees that he will accede to Cersei's request and free <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> if she wants him as a "pet", though he doesn't want him back on the Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade>.
<entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> "<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>" Baelish arrives at King <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly Baratheon</entidade>'s camp as a political envoy from King <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade> at <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. He tries to gain Renly's trust by implying that if Renly does march on the capital, he will help take down the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> from within (it is unclear if he is lying, but he is also ready to jump ship if the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> lose, and <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> is not an option, because <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> despises <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>); Renly is tempted by the notion, despite his dislike for <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> then has a conversation with <entidade:Queen Margaery>Queen Margaery</entidade> Tyrell in which he tries to intimidate her by hinting that her husband is homosexual. He does not anticipate that Margaery seems to already know and not to care. Margaery is not a naive ingenue like <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> but versed in court strategies: she honestly believes that Renly is the best candidate for king, and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between Renly and <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade>. Baelish then meets with <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade>, who is still furious at his betrayal of her husband to his death. Baelish first tries to kindle a romance with her, saying that now they are both free, it may be that they can be together. Catelyn simply draws a dagger and demands that he stop speaking. <entidade:Discouraged>Discouraged</entidade>, he moves on to present <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s offer that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> want to make a prisoner exchange with the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>: if they release <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade> will release both <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> (Baelish lies about the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> having <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>). Catelyn insists that Robb would never allow the exchange, but <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters. As a show of good faith from <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, Baelish brings forward a pair of <entidade:Silent Sisters>Silent Sisters</entidade> carrying a box containing the remains of <entidade:<entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Deeply>Deeply</entidade> grieving, Catelyn tells <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> to get out. She looks at the bones with pain, but then shuts the box with a look of resolve on her face.

    The shadow wrenches itself free from <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s womb.  
King <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon then arrives at Renly's camp, along with the Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade> <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> in his retinue. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> has come to treat with Renly and give him the chance to willingly relinquish his claim and serve his older brother. Renly, along with his <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> members <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> Tyrell, counters that no one wants <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> to be king. Renly also scoffs at <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' conversion to the religion of the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade>. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> criticizes both brothers for acting like sulking children. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> counters that it is odd that Catelyn is standing alongside Renly, given that her own husband <entidade:<entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade> rejected Renly's initial plan to claim the throne and supported <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> as <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> rightful heir, even at the cost of his own life. In a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> offers Renly that if he relinquishes his claim, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> will grant him his old seat on the small council, and even name him as his heir (unless <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> ever has a son in the future). Catelyn reminds <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> that their common enemy is the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, but he will not hear it, again asserting his right to the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. Renly states that the 100,000 soldiers waving his banners makes him king, and <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' small army is hopelessly outnumbered. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> says that they shall see the next morning when their armies clash, and he departs. As she leaves <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> warns, "Look to your sins <entidade:Lord Renly>Lord Renly</entidade>, for the night is dark and full of terrors." Renly watches his brother fade into the distance and asks his companions if they can believe that he loved <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> once.
At King <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' command, <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> rows <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> to some caves located near Renly's camp. Davos knows these caves from his old smuggling days. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> asks him about whether he desires her, and his views on the conflict they are involved in between right and wrong, insisting that she is on the side of good. They find the way through the caves is blocked by metal bars. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> takes off her cloak revealing that she is naked and heavily pregnant and promptly "gives birth" to a creature made entirely of shadow, as <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> looks on in horror.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    The main gate of <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade> opens for Daenerys.  
On the return of her bloodrider <entidade:Kovarro>Kovarro</entidade>, Daenerys receives word that the city of <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade> is nearby, and they are willing to receive the "<entidade:<entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade> of <entidade:Gold Dragons>Dragons</entidade>><entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade> of <entidade:Gold Dragons>Dragons</entidade></entidade>." <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> cautions that the desert surrounding <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade> is known as the "<entidade:Garden of Bones>Garden of Bones</entidade>," as those who are turned away by <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade> perish outside the city walls due to exposure and thirst. Daenerys and her <entidade:Khalasar>Khalasar</entidade> leave the <entidade:Red Waste>Red Waste</entidade> and reach the city of <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>. The <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade>, a group of wealthy nobles and merchant princes, the leaders of <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>, emerge to greet her, guarded by a group of shielded spearmen. <entidade:One>One</entidade> of the <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade>, the <entidade:Spice King>Spice King</entidade>, speaks for the group. They request that the "<entidade:<entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade> of <entidade:Gold Dragons>Dragons</entidade>><entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade> of <entidade:Gold Dragons>Dragons</entidade></entidade>" present her children, but Daenerys insists that her people be fed and sheltered before she reveals her dragons. The <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade> decide to turn Daenerys' group away and abandon them to the <entidade:Garden of Bones>Garden of Bones</entidade>. Daenerys swears vengeance on <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>, with "fire and blood," should they not comply. Jorah seems to find these threats rather reckless, but one of the <entidade:Thirteen>Thirteen</entidade>, <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> <entidade:Xhoan Daxos>Xhoan Daxos</entidade>, chooses to vouch for <entidade:Daenerys through Sumai>Daenerys through Sumai</entidade>, a blood oath by which a Qartheen may vouch for a visitor. Daenerys and her <entidade:Khalasar>Khalasar</entidade> are let into <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>.
