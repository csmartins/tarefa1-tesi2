A massive battle rages for control of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>.


    <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> singing with the Lannister soldiers  
<entidade:<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> leads the defense of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> against an assault by King <entidade:<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. He spends the night before the expected siege in bed with <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, telling her she can still leave the city. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> has <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> provide him with a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> tells <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that he is all that stands between them and defeat. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> drinks with the Lannister men and has a confrontation with the Hound, who is here first beginning to show the emotional and political fluctuations he will experience in the coming battle and which will shape his destiny for the rest of the series. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> plans a naval assault aiming to overcome the city's small defensive fleet and land his troops at the walls of the city near the <entidade:Mud Gate>Mud Gate</entidade>. 

    <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> fires the arrow that triggers the wildfire explosion.  
From the battlements, Joffrey berates <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, demanding to know why his ships are not meeting <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s fleet. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> has anticipated his strategy and does not field his fleet. Instead he sends a single ship filled with <entidade:Wildfire>Wildfire</entidade> into the heart of <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s fleet, leaking the volatile substance over the surface of the water. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> has been awaiting <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s signal outside the city on the shores of the bay, and when <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> tosses a torch from the battlements, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> fires a flaming arrow triggering a massive, massive aquatic explosion. The ensuing conflagration devastates <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s fleet and destroys the ship of his high captain, <entidade:<entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth><entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth</entidade>, as well as killing <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade>'s son, <entidade:Matthos Seaworth>Matthos</entidade>.

    Sandor breaks down.  
<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> responds by putting his men ashore inside row boats, landing further from the walls to avoid the still burning inner bay. With less protection for his troops he predicts that thousands will die. He leads the assault personally and is the first to reach the walls. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> orders <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> to lead a sortie beyond the <entidade:Mud Gate>Mud Gate</entidade> to repel the attackers. Sandor does as asked but is terrified by the fire and breaks down emotionally. Ser <entidade:<entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> Lannister</entidade> accompanies him and is wounded by an arrow. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> joins the fight in time to save the Hound's life. The Hound retreats after losing half of his men and refuses to go out again. He demands wine and walks away from the battle and his place in the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, after saying in the presence of all, including the king, "<entidade:Fuck>Fuck</entidade> the kings guard. <entidade:Fuck>Fuck</entidade> the city. <entidade:Fuck>Fuck</entidade> the king."
Queen <entidade:Regent>Regent</entidade> <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> offers protection to the ladies of the court in Maegor's Holdfast. She had earlier obtained Essence of Nightshade (which is deadly unless taken in tiny amounts) from Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> and keeps the headsman Ser <entidade:<entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn</entidade> Payne><entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn</entidade> Payne</entidade> at her side at all times, preparing for the worst. She drinks wine heavily during the assault and seems, to simultaneously torment and mother her captive, <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, with a sort of cynical feminism involving dire descriptions of the rapes that will occur if the city falls. She also begins to question <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, who seems to her perhaps an unlikely handmaiden. When <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> comes to tell her that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> has reached the walls Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey back to the <entidade:Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>>Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade></entidade>, ignoring his protests that it would damage morale.

    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> rallies the troops  
Joffrey willingly leaves the defensive line with <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> and charges Ser <entidade:<entidade:Mandon Moore>Mandon</entidade> Moore><entidade:Mandon Moore>Mandon</entidade> Moore</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Boros Blount>Boros Blount</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> to fight in the King's name. The gold cloaks' morale is broken by his departure. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> steels himself to lead a sortie of his own. He rallies his men by telling them to fight for their city, their homes and their women, if not for their king and utters his famous line, "Those are brave men are knocking at our door. <entidade:Let>Let</entidade>'s go kill them!" He leads his men through the tunnels beneath the city and is able to defeat <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s troops manning a battering ram at the <entidade:Mud Gate>Mud Gate</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is betrayed by Ser <entidade:Mandon Moore>Mandon</entidade> while fighting against a group of reinforcements. <entidade:Mandon Moore>Mandon</entidade> slashes <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> across the face with his sword. Before he can strike <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> again, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s squire <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> kills Ser <entidade:Mandon Moore>Mandon</entidade> from behind with his spear. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, barely conscious and held by Podrick watches a battleÂ that seems lost.

    <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> wounded by arrow to shoulder  
<entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> returns to Cersei to warn that they are defeated unless Joffrey returns. When <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> tries to be firm with her, Cersei ignores his counsel, pushes him out of the way (deliberately causing him pain by hitting his injured side), and storms out. Sansa tries to keep up the morale of the other women, frightened by Cersei's sudden departure. Sansa leads them in singing a hymn. Cersei has taken <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> to the throne room. She sits with him on the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, and tells him a story about a young lion and how it did not need to fear other beasts of the forest, the wolf and the stag. As she does this, she readies the poison for herself and for her son. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> tells Sansa to go to her chambers, lock herself in, and await <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, as he would not harm her, but Ser <entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn</entidade> might. Sansa finds the Hound waiting in her room. He offers to take her north to <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, but she says she will be safe there when <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> takes the throne. 

    Cersei and <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> on the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> as the battle rages.  
The Hound scares Sansa, but tells her to look at him, saying that since the world is made up of killers like <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, her father, her brother Robb, and he himself, she better get used to looking at them. Though he promises to protect her, she is still too afraid of him to go with him. Cersei sits on the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> and prepares to poison <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> in order to prevent him from being taken captive.

    <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> and <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> lead their victorious forces into the throne room.  
The forces of <entidade:<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and, it is revealed, his new allies in <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> join the battle. Their cavalry charge is led by a warrior dressed in the armor of <entidade:<entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> and it decimates <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s army. The survivors flee to their ships. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is dragged from the battle by his guards, screaming for his men to stand and fight. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> collapses into unconsciousness as the battle turns in the <entidade:Crown>Crown</entidade>'s favor. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> bursts into the throne room and announces their victory, just in time to stop Cersei from killing <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>. Ser <entidade:<entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> Tyrell><entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> Tyrell</entidade> reveals himself as the knight wearing <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>'s armor.
