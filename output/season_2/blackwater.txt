A massive battle rages for control of <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> and the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>.


    <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> singing with the Lannister soldiers  
<entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> leads the defense of <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> against an assault by King <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. He spends the night before the expected siege in bed with <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, telling her she can still leave the city. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> has <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> provide him with a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he is all that stands between them and defeat. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> drinks with the Lannister men and has a confrontation with the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>, who is here first beginning to show the emotional and political fluctuations he will experience in the coming battle and which will shape his destiny for the rest of the series. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> plans a naval assault aiming to overcome the city's small defensive fleet and land his troops at the walls of the city near the <entidade:Mud Gate>Mud Gate</entidade>. 

    <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> fires the arrow that triggers the wildfire explosion.  
From the battlements, Joffrey berates <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, demanding to know why his ships are not meeting <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s fleet. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> has anticipated his strategy and does not field his fleet. Instead he sends a single ship filled with <entidade:Wildfire>Wildfire</entidade> into the heart of <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s fleet, leaking the volatile substance over the surface of the water. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> has been awaiting <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s signal outside the city on the shores of the bay, and when <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> tosses a torch from the battlements, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> fires a flaming arrow triggering a massive, massive aquatic explosion. The ensuing conflagration devastates <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s fleet and destroys the ship of his high captain, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade>, as well as killing Davos's son, <entidade:Matthos Seaworth>Matthos</entidade>.

    Sandor breaks down.  
<entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> responds by putting his men ashore inside row boats, landing further from the walls to avoid the still burning inner bay. With less protection for his troops he predicts that thousands will die. He leads the assault personally and is the first to reach the walls. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> orders <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> to lead a sortie beyond the <entidade:Mud Gate>Mud Gate</entidade> to repel the attackers. Sandor does as asked but is terrified by the fire and breaks down emotionally. Ser <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade> accompanies him and is wounded by an arrow. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> joins the fight in time to save the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>'s life. The <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> retreats after losing half of his men and refuses to go out again. He demands wine and walks away from the battle and his place in the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, after saying in the presence of all, including the king, "Fuck the kings guard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king."
<entidade:Queen Cersei><entidade:Queen <entidade:Queen Regent>Regent</entidade>>Queen <entidade:Queen Regent>Regent</entidade></entidade> Cersei</entidade> Lannister offers protection to the ladies of the court in Maegor's Holdfast. She had earlier obtained <entidade:Essence of Nightshade>Essence of Nightshade</entidade> (which is deadly unless taken in tiny amounts) from Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> and keeps the headsman <entidade:Ser Ilyn>Ser Ilyn</entidade> Payne at her side at all times, preparing for the worst. She drinks wine heavily during the assault and seems, to simultaneously torment and mother her captive, <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, with a sort of cynical feminism involving dire descriptions of the rapes that will occur if the city falls. She also begins to question <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, who seems to her perhaps an unlikely handmaiden. When Lancel comes to tell her that <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> has reached the walls Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey back to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, ignoring his protests that it would damage morale.

    <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> rallies the troops  
Joffrey willingly leaves the defensive line with Lancel and charges <entidade:Ser Mandon>Ser Mandon</entidade> Moore and <entidade:Ser Boros Blount>Ser Boros Blount</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> to fight in the King's name. The gold cloaks' morale is broken by his departure. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> steels himself to lead a sortie of his own. He rallies his men by telling them to fight for their city, their homes and their women, if not for their king and utters his famous line, "Those are brave men are knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!" He leads his men through the tunnels beneath the city and is able to defeat <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s troops manning a battering ram at the <entidade:Mud Gate>Mud Gate</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is betrayed by <entidade:Ser Mandon>Ser Mandon</entidade> while fighting against a group of reinforcements. Mandon slashes <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> across the face with his sword. Before he can strike <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> again, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s squire <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> kills <entidade:Ser Mandon>Ser Mandon</entidade> from behind with his spear. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, barely conscious and held by Podrick watches a battleÂ that seems lost.

    Lancel wounded by arrow to shoulder  
Lancel returns to Cersei to warn that they are defeated unless Joffrey returns. When Lancel tries to be firm with her, Cersei ignores his counsel, pushes him out of the way (deliberately causing him pain by hitting his injured side), and storms out. Sansa tries to keep up the morale of the other women, frightened by Cersei's sudden departure. Sansa leads them in singing a hymn. Cersei has taken Tommen to the throne room. She sits with him on the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>, and tells him a story about a young lion and how it did not need to fear other beasts of the forest, the wolf and the stag. As she does this, she readies the poison for herself and for her son. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> tells Sansa to go to her chambers, lock herself in, and await <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, as he would not harm her, but <entidade:Ser Ilyn>Ser Ilyn</entidade> might. Sansa finds the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> waiting in her room. He offers to take her north to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, but she says she will be safe there when <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> takes the throne. 

    Cersei and Tommen on the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> as the battle rages.  
The <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> scares Sansa, but tells her to look at him, saying that since the world is made up of killers like <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, her father, her brother Robb, and he himself, she better get used to looking at them. Though he promises to protect her, she is still too afraid of him to go with him. Cersei sits on the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> and prepares to poison Tommen in order to prevent him from being taken captive.

    <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> and Loras lead their victorious forces into the throne room.  
The forces of <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and, it is revealed, his new allies in <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> join the battle. Their cavalry charge is led by a warrior dressed in the armor of <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly Baratheon</entidade> and it decimates <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s army. The survivors flee to their ships. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> is dragged from the battle by his guards, screaming for his men to stand and fight. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> collapses into unconsciousness as the battle turns in the <entidade:Crown>Crown</entidade>'s favor. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> bursts into the throne room and announces their victory, just in time to stop Cersei from killing Tommen. <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> Tyrell reveals himself as the knight wearing Renly's armor.
