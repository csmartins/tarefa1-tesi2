Arya has a surprise visitor; <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> vows to take what is hers; Joffrey meets his subjects; Qhorin gives Jon a chance to prove himself.


In the North
    Theon approaches <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>, then takes over <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>.  
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> frantically sends off a messenger raven just as a band of raiders from <entidade:House Greyjoy>House Greyjoy</entidade>, led by Theon Greyjoy, take over the undefended castle. Theon had lured the defenders away with a feint at <entidade:Torrhen <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade>>Torrhen</entidade>'s Square and then infiltrated the castle using grappling claws. Theon tells <entidade:Bran Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> to surrender the castle to him to save his people. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> submits in front of his assembled people. Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel><entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik</entidade> Cassel</entidade> is captured by Theon's men as he is returning from <entidade:Torrhen <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade>>Torrhen</entidade>'s Square. He spits in Theon's face, and <entidade:Dagmer>Dagmer</entidade> Cleftjaw insists that Theon must kill him, or lose face in front of his ironborn raiders. Theon botches the beheading of Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik</entidade>, requiring several hacks and a kick, horrifying the people of <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night, <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> the wildling has sex with Theon, but then sneaks out of his room while he is asleep. <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> frees <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>, <entidade:Rickon Stark><entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark</entidade>, <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>, and their direwolves, <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> and <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade>, smuggling them out of the castle and killing one of Theon's guards in the process.

 In the <entidade:Westerlands>Westerlands</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s army camp, Robb chats with <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade>, who has followed his forces on their campaign. Robb introduces <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade> to his mother <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade>, who has returned from the <entidade:Stormlands>Stormlands</entidade> along with <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of Tarth. They are interrupted when Lord <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> arrives with the terrible news sent by <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade>'s last messenger raven. Furious at Theon's betrayal, Robb intends to march his army back to the North to repel the invasion. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> advises that the few hundred soldiers left scattered in the North can be rallied by his bastard son, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay Snow</entidade>, who is in the North at the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>. They could overcome the small <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> invasion force. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> warns that retreating the entire <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> army group would lose everything they have gained. Robb agrees, but insists that <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>'s men take Theon alive so Robb can look him in the eyes and ask "Why?" before personally executing him.

 In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, the main base camp for the <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> army in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, <entidade:Tywin Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> berates Ser <entidade:Amory Lorch>Amory Lorch</entidade> for delivering a letter to their enemies instead of their allies, because he cannot read properly. He discovers that his cupbearer "Arry" (secretly <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade>) can read. 

    Joffrey has excrement thrown on him by rioting peasants.  
Petyr "<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>" Baelish arrives at camp and meets with <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. Arya tries to hide her face to prevent <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> from identifying her. Baelish discusses the assassination of <entidade:Renly Baratheon><entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>, and the subsequent rallying of the noble Houses from the <entidade:Stormlands>Stormlands</entidade> under the banner of his older brother <entidade:Stannis Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>. However, <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> of the <entidade:Reach>Reach</entidade> has retreated its large army back to their capital at <entidade:Highgarden>Highgarden</entidade>, and has not joined <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>. Baelish discusses with <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> the possibility of forming an alliance between <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade>.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> questions Arya about her origins. While <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is distracted, Arya sees that a letter on his table is about her older brother <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>, so she snatches it. After asking <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> about his own father, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> sends her to fetch more firewood. She takes this opportunity to read the letter, but unfortunately bumps into <entidade:Amory Lorch>Amory Lorch</entidade> who sees that she is carrying the letter and grows suspicious. Arya runs away and Amory heads to tell <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. Arya runs to find <entidade:Jaqen H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>'ghar, telling him that <entidade:Amory Lorch>Amory Lorch</entidade> is the second name he owes her. Just as <entidade:Amory Lorch>Amory Lorch</entidade> reaches <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>'s quarters, he falls down dead with a poisoned dart lodged in his neck.

 In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
The royal court including King <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade>, Queen <entidade:Regent>Regent</entidade> <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Tommen Baratheon><entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>, and <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> are at the docks seeing off Princess <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella Baratheon</entidade> as she departs in a ship bound for <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>. Cersei is heartbroken and warns <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that she will not forgive him for sending away her only daughter. 
As per <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s plans, Myrcella will stay in <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> with <entidade:House Martell>House Martell</entidade> until she comes of age to fulfill the marriage alliance to their youngest son, <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane Martell</entidade>. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Septon>Septon</entidade>>High <entidade:High Septon>Septon</entidade></entidade> of the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> of the Seven offers a blessing for her departure. The streets of the capital city are overflowing with starving refugees from the <entidade:War>War</entidade> of the Five Kings, as Cersei ignored both <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade>'s earlier warnings that something had to be done to care for the starving peasants or there would be mounting discontent with her son's rule.
As the royal party travels back to the <entidade:Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>>Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade></entidade> through the crowded streets, the starving refugees and commoners of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> plead for bread and hurl insults at King Joffrey, and ultimately, someone throws cow excrement into Joffrey's face. Despite being accompanied by only a few dozen guards facing hundreds of peasants, Joffrey impetuously orders his soldiers to kill the entire crowd. 

    Sansa is almost raped.  
A riot subsequently erupts and spreads throughout the city. The royal party's guards are soon overwhelmed, and Joffrey, Cersei and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> barely make it back to the castle unscathed. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Septon>Septon</entidade>>High <entidade:High Septon>Septon</entidade></entidade> is literally torn apart by the mob.
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is enraged by Joffrey's shocking stupidity, for massively overreacting to having cow dung thrown at him, and for not realizing that his orders would cause a riot among the starving peasants and endanger the entire royal party. Joffrey, still manically cursing the mob and demanding they all be killed, shrieks that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> cannot speak to him in that way and petulantly reminds his uncle that he is talking to a king. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> then contemptuously slaps his nephew across the face but Joffrey does not retaliate. The scant two thousand <entidade:City Watch><entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> Watch</entidade> guards have difficulty containing the riot, and chaos reigns throughout the city. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> realizes to his horror that <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> was lost in the crowd. Joffrey petulantly refuses to send his men after her, oblivious to her importance as a hostage or the fact that if any harm comes to her, the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> may retaliate by executing his uncle Jaime. Outside, Sansa is dragged away by a mob of angry men and is about to be raped, when Sandor "The Hound" Clegane arrives and slays her assailants. He carries Sansa to the castle and orders handmaids to take care of her. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> thanks him for saving Sansa's life, but Sandor bluntly responds that he didn't do it for him.

<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>
    Jon first lays eyes on <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>.  
The scouting party of the Night's Watch led by <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin Halfhand</entidade> has left the expeditionary base their main force set up at the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade> of the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade>, and continues searching for the wildlings in the <entidade:Frostfangs>Frostfangs</entidade> mountain range. They encounter a small group of wildling scouts and engage them in combat, killing all except one: a red-haired young woman named <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>. Qhorin orders <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> to execute her while the rest of them continue on up the mountain. Jon hesitates, giving <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> enough time to make a run for it. Jon pursues and captures <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>, but they have become separated from Qhorin's scouting party. With darkness falling, Jon and his prisoner have to settle in for the night, hoping to link back up with Qhorin when daylight returns.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daenerys discovers that her guards have been slain and her dragons are missing.  
In <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>, Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> tries to negotiate with the <entidade:Spice King>Spice King</entidade> for ships to return to <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. However, he considers it to be too risky an investment – considering that she has no army and has no open supporters in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> – and she receives nothing. Returning with <entidade:Xaro>Xaro</entidade> Xhoan Daxos to his mansion, Daenerys finds her guards dead, <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> strangled to death, and her dragons missing. A hooded figure carries the dragons in a covered box up steps towards a tower.
