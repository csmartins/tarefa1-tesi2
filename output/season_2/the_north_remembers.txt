Under the burning <entidade:Red Comet>Red Comet</entidade> in the sky, war grips the continent of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> arrives at court to serve as acting <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King, and to rein in his crazed nephew King Joffrey, as well as Queen <entidade:Regent>Regent</entidade> Cersei. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> begins his quest to take the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> with the help of a mysterious foreign priestess. <entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> the eastern continent, Daenerys leads her people through the <entidade:Red Waste>Red Waste</entidade>. <entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, rangers, led by Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jeor Mormont><entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> Mormont</entidade>, seek help from a dangerous wildling.


<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>
    The Night's Watch approaches Crasters <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>.  
Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jeor Mormont><entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> Mormont</entidade>'s rangers arrive at Craster's <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade> having passed several abandoned wildling villages. <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>, <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade>, <entidade:Dolorous Edd>Dolorous Edd</entidade> and <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> are repulsed by Craster, who has many wives, most of whom are also his own daughters, but who seemingly has no sons. Craster tells <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> that he has not seen the missing <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen Stark</entidade> and reports that the other wildlings are assembling for the King-<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade>-the-<entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>. Jon challenges their host, who is low and crude, but is demanding and demeaning when he is talking to the noble <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> Mormont (who ignores his insulting behavior). When Craster refers to them as southerners, Jon argues with him. <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> reprimands Jon, noting that Craster may be disgusting, but the Night's Watch needs him. His information and shelter in the harsh conditions north of the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> have helped them many times before. Mormont asks Jon if someday he wants to lead and tells him that first he needs to "learn how to follow."

In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
    Sansa watches King Joffrey's tournament.  
King <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade> holds a tournament to celebrate his nameday on the walls of the <entidade:Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>>Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade></entidade>. He is irritated by Ser <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> <entidade:Hollard>Hollard</entidade>, who arrives both late and intoxicated for his bout. Joffrey orders his guards to pour an entire barrel of wine down <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade>' throat with a funnel. <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> intercedes telling Joffrey that ordering a death on one's name day is bad luck. Joffrey dismisses this as a mindless superstition, but <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> seconds her. Sansa convinces Joffrey to instead make <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> his court fool, for which <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> is grateful. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> arrives back in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, to Joffrey's disdain, but to the delight of <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> and Myrcella who had worried that he was dead.

    Cersei is surprised to see <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> return.  
The small council are in session to discuss the <entidade:Conclave>Conclave</entidade>'s announcement that the long summer has ended. Cersei orders the city gates closed to refugees from the war in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. When <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> arrives with a letter from Lord <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>, appointing him as acting <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King in <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>'s stead, Cersei becomes livid. She is suspicious that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is taking power for himself, but he convinces her that he is there to act as an advisor. He criticizes his sister for failing to rein in Joffrey and overseeing numerous bad decisions, particularly the execution of <entidade:Ned Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade>. Their actions have sparked a war, which, he adds, their side is currently losing. He is even more incredulous when he learns that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade> escaped, pointing out how much stronger their position could have been with three Stark hostages. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> hides his lover <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> in his chambers in the <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade> of the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> because he was forbidden by his father to bring her with him. She is initially thrilled at being brought to the capitol, and says that big cities make her "want to fuck".
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> suffers through the petty complaints of his vassals, facing unrest at <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade> calling his banners and taking the young men south. <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> guides him in carrying out a lord's duties. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> dreams that he is his direwolf <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> walking in the <entidade:Godswood>Godswood</entidade>, and when he looks in the pool, he sees <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>'s reflection not his own which wakes him. He has <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> and <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> take him to the pool and is reassured to find that his waking reflection is his own. They discuss the phenomenon of the <entidade:Red Comet>Red Comet</entidade>, as many people think it means different things. <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> tells him she believes it signifies the return of dragons to the world.

    <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> orders the burning of the Seven to honor the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>.  
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> the island of <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, King <entidade:Stannis Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> allows his advisor <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> to burn statues of the gods of the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> of the Seven as an offering to her deity the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Cressen>Cressen</entidade> is outraged at the affront to his gods and fearful that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is leading <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> into a war that he cannot win. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> proclaims <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> a champion of the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>, as he draws a burning sword from one of the statues. <entidade:Cressen>Cressen</entidade> asks <entidade:Davos Seaworth><entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth</entidade> to help him intervene but <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> says that it is not the right time.

    <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> dictates a letter about Joffrey's parentage.  
<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> has received <entidade:Ned Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade>'s letter, informing him that he was the true heir of King <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade>, so he will send copies of a letter announcing his claim to the throne of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> to Lords throughout the realm. He details the incestuous relationship between Cersei and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> and challenges Joffrey's legitimacy. He rejects <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade>'s appeal to consider an alliance with his brother <entidade:Renly Baratheon><entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>, while <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> is claiming the throne for himself, despite <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> having widespread support, or even with <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>, since while Robb does not seek the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, he desires <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> independence, which <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> sees as Robb "stealing the <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> half of his kingdom." <entidade:Cressen>Cressen</entidade> feigns an apology in an effort to trick <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> into sharing a cup of poisoned wine with him. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> sees him drop the poison in the cup, and tries to stop him. He drinks first and hands the cup to her. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is aware of what <entidade:Cressen>Cressen</entidade> is doing, but smiling she drinks anyway and is unaffected by the poison, and <entidade:Cressen>Cressen</entidade> dies in vain.

    Robb confronts Jaime with his direwolf.  
    <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade> and Jaime.  
Robb receives the letter and interrogates the captive Jaime about his reasons for crippling <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>. Jaime reveals nothing and attacks Robb's decision to keep him in his mobile camp rather than with one of his bannermen as demonstrating a lack of trust. Robb asserts his faith in his men and his concern at the lengths <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> would go to in order to free Jaime. His direwolf <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade> is almost fully grown and menaces Jaime during the questioning. Robb sends his prisoner <entidade:Alton Lannister><entidade:Alton Lannister>Alton</entidade> Lannister</entidade> to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> with peace terms. His demands include the release of his sisters, the return of his father's remains along with the remains of all those who served him, and the recognition of the North as a free and independent kingdom. Theon Greyjoy appeals to Robb to send him to <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade> to seek an alliance with his father Balon citing their need for a fleet in order to attack King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. Catelyn counsels against putting trust in Balon because of his history of rebellion. She asks Robb to consider exchanging Jaime for his sisters. She then asks to return to her younger sons at <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> but Robb tasks her with seeking an alliance with <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> and sends Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel><entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik</entidade> Cassel</entidade> instead to <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>.

    Cersei asks a favor of Lord Baelish.  
Cersei tasks <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> with finding Arya. She needles Petyr about his unrequited love for Catelyn and he counters by referencing her relationship with Jaime, telling her that knowledge is power. She responds by threatening his life in a demonstration of her control over her guards, ordering them to first seize Baelish and cut his throat and almost immediately rescinding the order. She warns him that power is power.
Joffrey redecorates his throne room, hoping to restore the intimidating grandeur it held under the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade>. He refuses his mother's suggestion that they ask <entidade:Tywin Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> for aid in the search for Arya because he does not feel it is necessary to find her and does not feel it is fitting for a king to ask for help. He blames <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> for their losses in the war and the capture of Jaime. <entidade:Having>Having</entidade> heard rumors about his parentage, he confronts his mother. She dismisses it as gossip spread by his enemies. He questions her about his father's bastard children and insults her by saying that Robert had grown tired of her. She slaps him, and he warns her never to hit him again under threat of death.
Lord <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade> leads a city-wide massacre of Robert's bastards. The infant <entidade:Barra>Barra</entidade> is killed in Petyr's brothel in front of her mother and the prostitute Ros. <entidade:Tobho <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Mott</entidade>>Tobho <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Mott</entidade></entidade> is interrogated and reveals that <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> has left the city as a recruit of the Night's Watch. He says that <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> can be identified by his bull's head helm. <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> and Arya are travelling north on the <entidade:Kingsroad>Kingsroad</entidade> with <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade>'s recruits.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daenerys leads her people through the <entidade:Red Waste>Red Waste</entidade>.  
Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> leads her diminished khalasar east into the <entidade:Red Waste>Red Waste</entidade> to avoid her rivals. She is surrounded by powerful enemies who Ser Jorah tells her will kill her and take her dragons. The deadly emptiness of the <entidade:Red Waste>Red Waste</entidade> is her only option. She struggles to make her dragons eat what little meat she has, and her people face starvation. Her beloved white mare, her first gift from <entidade:Khal <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>>Khal <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade></entidade>, dies prompting her to halt the march and send three of her bloodriders in three different directions to scout for sustenance and refuge.
