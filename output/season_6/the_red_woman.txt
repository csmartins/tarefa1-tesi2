    <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick</entidade> meet <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and Theon.  
<entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> and <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Wolkan>Wolkan</entidade> attend to the dead body of <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> remembers the first time he met her, stating that while other people were afraid of him, she wasn't. The <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> asks if they should bury her or construct a funeral pyre. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> says she is good meat and they should feed her to the hounds.
Theon and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, having survived the fall from Winterfell's wall, run through the <entidade:Wolfswood>Wolfswood</entidade> realizing there are already men with hounds chasing them. Theon tries to hide their scent by crossing a river. Guiding a frightened <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, they make it across and hide by a fallen tree with Theon hugging <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> to try to keep her warm. Hearing the dogs still after them, Theon tries to lead them away, telling <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> to keep heading north for <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. A group of <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> men sent by <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade>, with the Bastard's Girls, find them. Theon claims <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> was hurt when they jumped and he left her to die, but the dogs find her. The leader mocks Theon over what <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> will do to him now and prepares to bring them back to <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>. <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick</entidade> arrive and a fight begins. <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> kills most of them while <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick</entidade> displays the techniques she taught him, managing to kill one. He is then attacked by another and briefly holds his own before being knocked down but Theon grabs a sword and kills the <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> man. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> accepts <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> into her service. Where they go next is uncertain.
<entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> meets with <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> afterwards and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> makes him feel like a winner now that they've lost <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>. A <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade> army marching north could easily overwhelm the <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> troops at <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> and the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> assures his father they will recapture <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> as he's sent his best men to find her. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> continues that they need her to rally the north against the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, if need be, and subtly warns <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> that if he fails to recapture her, his unborn brother will become his heir.

<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is blind and asks for money in the streets, when the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> approaches her with two fighting sticks, and gives her one. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> explains that she can't fight because she's blind, the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> answers "that's not my problem" and starts beating her. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> poorly tries to defend herself but fails miserably, until the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> stops and says that they'll meet tomorrow.

    <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> walking through <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>.  
<entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> are seen walking through the city. After coming upon a woman and her baby, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> offers a coin, saying the money is for the baby, to eat. His poor <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> frightens the woman who thinks that he wants to eat her baby. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> intercedes, explaining to the woman the money is so the baby can eat. The relieved woman accepts Tyrion's generosity.
As they keep walking through the city, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> states that they need to find the leader of the <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade> in order to bring peace to <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> said that his spies have been sent all over the city, and that soon they will bring him information. Their conversation is interrupted by a crowd of screaming people running from a huge cloud of smoke. The two make their way towards the origin of the smoke: all the ships in the harbor have been set aflame.

<entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> and <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> are looking for <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade>, and come upon the charred remains of a ram. They note numerous hoof prints on the ground, making <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> realize that the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> have been here. <entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> the ground, he finds the ring that <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> intentionally dropped.
<entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> is shown walking with her hands bound, and two <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> take her to <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal Moro</entidade> as a gift. The <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal</entidade> wants to rape her, but she explains who she is, <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal</entidade> Drogo's widow. The <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal</entidade> unbinds her and promises her that she will not be harmed. When <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> asks to be escorted back to <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> in exchange for the promise of one thousand horses for her safe return, Moro's wife tells her that she has to remain in the temple of Vaes <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothrak</entidade> with the other Khals' widows for the remainder of her days and become a <entidade:Dosh Khaleen>Dosh</entidade> khaleen.

    <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> dies after Elliaria's deception.  
<entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> helps <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> get to his wheelchair, as they both reminisce about <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>, with <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> stating how he envied his late brother for the adventurous life he led. <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> states that <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> would have made a bad adventurer, while <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> would have been a bad ruler. After settling into his chair, <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Caleotte>Caleotte</entidade> brings him a message that <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> has died. Before he can give an order, <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> stabs <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade> in the back, killing him, while <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> stabs <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> in the chest. As he lies on the floor, his guards do nothing, indicating they have sided with <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade>. As she twists her knife into <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade>, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> angrily says he remained passive despite the brutal deaths of both his sister and brother, and that the people of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> are with her, now. As he is gasping, <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> begs <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> to spare <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade>, but <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> coldly scoffs at him. <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> then dies in a pool of his own blood.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
    Myrcella's corpse arrives from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>.  
<entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is sitting alone in her room, when a servant enters and announces that a ship from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> has arrived. Realizing that <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> has come home, she joyfully runs down to the harbor, only to see a grim-faced <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> alongside a shrouded body. She tearfully realizes that her daughter has died.
Later, in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> asks <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> when was the first time he saw a dead body, to which <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> replies their mother's. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> tells of her memory of the horror she felt after first seeing her mother's corpse, and wishes not to see it happen to <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade>.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> is still imprisoned by the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade>, and the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> comes to visit her. She asks about her brother, <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>, but he tells her that she has to confess first. When she admits that nobody is perfect without sins, he tells her that she is on the right path but still has a long way to go.
<entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> and <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria</entidade> arrive on <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> Trystane's ship, announcing their intention to kill him. <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria</entidade> offers <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> the choice of which one of the <entidade:Sands>Sands</entidade> he'd like to fight, and he chooses <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria</entidade>, only for <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> to impale him through the back of his head with her spear as he turns his back on her.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the mutineers have left Jon's body where he fell. <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> is scratching at the door in grief and howling, which gets the attention of several people, including <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade>, who leaves his room to investigate. Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> finds Jon's dead body just before <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> and some other brothers arrive. They take the body inside where <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> clears a table and angrily curses <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> after closing Jon's eyes. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> asks if <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> trusts any of his brothers, and <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> replies, "The ones in this room." <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> convinces <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> to go bring <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> in, deciding that they need all the help they can get. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> arrives, stating she saw <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> fighting in <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> in the flames. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> and the black brothers doubt the dead <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> could do such a thing and she returns to her room.
<entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade>, <entidade:Othell Yarwyck>Othell Yarwyck</entidade>, and <entidade:Bowen Marsh>Bowen Marsh</entidade> hold a meeting with the remaining black brothers stationed at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> and explain their reasoning for killing the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade>. Most of the brothers come to understand them and side with the mutineers. <entidade:Sack>Back</entidade> inside the room, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> notes <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> is sure to have made his move by now. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> response, <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> states he doesn't care because <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> was his friend and they butchered him, then he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> in revenge. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> responds they are hopelessly outnumbered, stating <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> isn't enough when <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> brings him up, before reminding them there are others nearby who owe <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> their lives. Realizing he means the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade>, <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help.
All members of the <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> are shown bearing arms toward the room where Jon's body is being guarded by Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> and the men loyal to <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>. <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> and senior members of the <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> approach the room and <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> speaks to Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> through the locked door. <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> promises full amnesty for the members of the <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>. To Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes, and that he can take <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> with him. Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> mocks what he knows to be an insincere offer by requesting mutton. Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> tells <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> he is a poor hunter and does not want to starve, so he needs some mutton for his trip. <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> promises him food will be provided. Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> says the offer is available as long as everyone in the room surrenders, and does so by sundown.

    <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> without her magical glamor of youth.  
<entidade:Alone>Alone</entidade> in her bedroom, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> appears despondent and looking as if she has been betrayed or led astray by The <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. <entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> a table next to her bed are various containers, some small that contain potions and other liquids. She unbuttons the front of her dress showing a young beautiful body. She then removes the dress completely and stands nude before a mirror. When she removes her large necklace the gem loses its glow. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the mirror, Melisandre's reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be, a frail old woman with sagging breasts, leathery skin and thin wispy white hair. Fully nude, with her head bowed down in a despondent manner, she slowly climbs into bed and pulls the fur blanket on top of her.
