 In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>  Edit
    <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick meet Sansa>Podrick meet Sansa</entidade> and Theon.  
Ramsay and <entidade:Maester Wolkan>Maester Wolkan</entidade> attend to the dead body of <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>. Ramsay remembers the first time he met her, stating that while other people were afraid of him, she wasn't. The Maester asks if they should bury her or construct a funeral pyre. Ramsay says she is good meat and they should feed her to the hounds.
Theon and Sansa, having survived the fall from <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>'s wall, run through the <entidade:Wolfswood>Wolfswood</entidade> realizing there are already men with hounds chasing them. Theon tries to hide their scent by crossing a river. Guiding a frightened Sansa, they make it across and hide by a fallen tree with Theon hugging Sansa to try to keep her warm. Hearing the dogs still after them, Theon tries to lead them away, telling Sansa to keep heading north for Jon and <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. A group of <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> men sent by Ramsay, with the Bastard's Girls, find them. Theon claims Sansa was hurt when they jumped and he left her to die, but the dogs find her. The leader mocks Theon over what Ramsay will do to him now and prepares to bring them back to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick arrive and a fight begins. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> kills most of them while Podrick displays the techniques she taught him, managing to kill one. He is then attacked by another and briefly holds his own before being knocked down but Theon grabs a sword and kills the <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> man. Sansa accepts <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> into her service. Where they go next is uncertain.
Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> meets with Ramsay afterwards and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon makes him feel like a winner now that they've lost Sansa. A Lannister army marching north could easily overwhelm the <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> troops at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> and the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>. Ramsay assures his father they will recapture Sansa as he's sent his best men to find her. Roose continues that they need her to rally the north against the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, if need be, and subtly warns Ramsay that if he fails to recapture her, his unborn brother will become his heir.

 In <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>

His poor Valyrian frightens the woman who thinks that he wants to eat her baby. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> intercedes, explaining to the woman the money is so the baby can eat. The relieved woman accepts <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s generosity.
As they keep walking through the city, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> states that they need to find the leader of the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> in order to bring peace to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> said that his spies have been sent all over the city, and that soon they will bring him information. Their conversation is interrupted by a crowd of screaming people running from a huge cloud of smoke. The two make their way towards the origin of the smoke: all the ships in the harbor have been set aflame.

Daario and Jorah are looking for Daenerys, and come upon the charred remains of a ram. They note numerous hoof prints on the ground, making Jorah realize that the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> have been here. On the ground, he finds the ring that Daenerys intentionally dropped.
Daenerys is shown walking with her hands bound, and two <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> take her to <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal Moro</entidade> as a gift. The Khal wants to rape her, but she explains who she is, Khal <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> widow. The Khal unbinds her and promises her that she will not be harmed. When Daenerys asks to be escorted back to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> in exchange for the promise of one thousand horses for her safe return, Moro's wife tells her that she has to remain in the temple of <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> with the other <entidade:Khals>Khals</entidade>' widows for the remainder of her days and become a <entidade:Dosh Khaleen>Dosh</entidade> khaleen.

    Doran dies after <entidade:Elliaria>Elliaria</entidade>'s deception.  
Ellaria helps Doran get to his wheelchair, as they both reminisce about Oberyn, with Doran stating how he envied his late brother for the adventurous life he led. Ellaria states that Doran would have made a bad adventurer, while Oberyn would have been a bad ruler. After settling into his chair, <entidade:Maester Caleotte>Maester Caleotte</entidade> brings him a message that Myrcella has died. Before he can give an order, <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> stabs <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade> in the back, killing him, while Ellaria stabs Doran in the chest. As he lies on the floor, his guards do nothing, indicating they have sided with Ellaria. As she twists her knife into Doran, Ellaria angrily says he remained passive despite the brutal deaths of both his sister and brother, and that the people of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> are with her, now. As he is gasping, Doran begs Ellaria to spare Trystane, but Ellaria coldly scoffs at him. Doran then dies in a pool of his own blood.

 In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> 
    Myrcella's corpse arrives from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>.  
Cersei is sitting alone in her room, when a servant enters and announces that a ship from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> has arrived. Realizing that Myrcella has come home, she joyfully runs down to the harbor, only to see a grim-faced Jaime alongside a shrouded body. She tearfully realizes that her daughter has died.
Later, in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, Cersei asks Jaime when was the first time he saw a dead body, to which Jaime replies their mother's. Cersei tells of her memory of the horror she felt after first seeing her mother's corpse, and wishes not to see it happen to Myrcella.
Meanwhile, Margaery is still imprisoned by the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade>, and the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> comes to visit her. She asks about her brother, Loras, but he tells her that she has to confess first.

Nymeria offers Trystane the choice of which one of the <entidade:Sands>Sands</entidade> he'd like to fight, and he chooses Nymeria, only for <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> to impale him through the back of his head with her spear as he turns his back on her.

 At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the mutineers have left Jon's body where he fell. <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> is scratching at the door in grief and howling, which gets the attention of several people, including Davos, who leaves his room to investigate. <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> finds Jon's dead body just before Edd and some other brothers arrive. They take the body inside where Edd clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing Jon's eyes. Davos asks if Edd trusts any of his brothers, and Edd replies, "The ones in this room." Davos convinces Edd to go bring <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> in, deciding that they need all the help they can get. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> arrives, stating she saw Jon fighting in <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> in the flames. Davos and the black brothers doubt the dead <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> could do such a thing and she returns to her room.

Most of the brothers come to understand them and side with the mutineers. Back inside the room, Davos notes Thorne is sure to have made his move by now. In response, Edd states he doesn't care because Jon was his friend and they butchered him, then he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out Thorne in revenge. Davos responds they are hopelessly outnumbered, stating <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> isn't enough when Edd brings him up, before reminding them there are others nearby who owe Jon their lives. Realizing he means the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade>, Edd instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help.
All members of the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> are shown bearing arms toward the room where Jon's body is being guarded by <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> and the men loyal to <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>. Thorne and senior members of the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> approach the room and Thorne speaks to <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> through the locked door. Thorne promises full amnesty for the members of the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. To <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes, and that he can take <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> with him. <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> mocks what he knows to be an insincere offer by requesting mutton. <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> tells Thorne he is a poor hunter and does not want to starve, so he needs some mutton for his trip. Thorne promises him food will be provided. <entidade:Ser Thorne>Ser Thorne</entidade> says the offer is available as long as everyone in the room surrenders, and does so by sundown.

    <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> without her magical glamor of youth.  
Alone in her bedroom, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> appears despondent and looking as if she has been betrayed or led astray by The <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade>. On a table next to her bed are various containers, some small that contain potions and other liquids. She unbuttons the front of her dress showing a young beautiful body. She then removes the dress completely and stands nude before a mirror. When she removes her large necklace the gem loses its glow. In the mirror, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be, a frail old woman with sagging breasts, leathery skin and thin wispy white hair. Fully nude, with her head bowed down in a despondent manner, she slowly climbs into bed and pulls the fur blanket on top of her.
