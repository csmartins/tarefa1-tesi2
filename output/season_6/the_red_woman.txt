Sansa and Theon race the cold and the hounds.

 
 In the North  Edit
    <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick meet Sansa and Theon.  
Ramsay and <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Wolkan>Wolkan</entidade> attend to the dead body of <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>. Ramsay remembers the first time he met her, stating that while other people were afraid of him, she wasn't. The <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> asks if they should bury her or construct a funeral pyre. Ramsay says she is good meat and they should feed her to the hounds.
Theon and Sansa, having survived the fall from <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>'s wall, run through the <entidade:Wolfswood>Wolfswood</entidade> realizing there are already men with hounds chasing them. Theon tries to hide their scent by crossing a river. Guiding a frightened Sansa, they make it across and hide by a fallen tree with Theon hugging Sansa to try to keep her warm. Hearing the dogs still after them, Theon tries to lead them away, telling Sansa to keep heading north for Jon and <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>. A group of <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> men sent by Ramsay, with the Bastard's Girls, find them. Theon claims Sansa was hurt when they jumped and he left her to die, but the dogs find her. The leader mocks Theon over what Ramsay will do to him now and prepares to bring them back to <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick arrive and a fight begins. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> kills most of them while Podrick displays the techniques she taught him, managing to kill one. He is then attacked by another and briefly holds his own before being knocked down but Theon grabs a sword and kills the <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> man. Sansa accepts <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> into her service. Where they go next is uncertain.
<entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> meets with Ramsay afterwards and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of <entidade:<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> makes him feel like a winner now that they've lost Sansa. A Lannister army marching north could easily overwhelm the <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> troops at <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> and the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>. Ramsay assures his father they will recapture Sansa as he's sent his best men to find her. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> continues that they need her to rally the north against the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, if need be, and subtly warns Ramsay that if he fails to recapture her, his unborn brother will become his heir.

Arya explains that she can't fight because she's blind, the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> answers "that's not my problem" and starts beating her. Arya poorly tries to defend herself but fails miserably, until the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> stops and says that they'll meet tomorrow.

His poor Valyrian frightens the woman who thinks that he wants to eat her baby. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> intercedes, explaining to the woman the money is so the baby can eat. The relieved woman accepts <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s generosity.
As they keep walking through the city, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> states that they need to find the leader of the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> in order to bring peace to Meereen. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> said that his spies have been sent all over the city, and that soon they will bring him information. Their conversation is interrupted by a crowd of screaming people running from a huge cloud of smoke. The two make their way towards the origin of the smoke: all the ships in the harbor have been set aflame.

The Khal unbinds her and promises her that she will not be harmed. When Daenerys asks to be escorted back to Meereen in exchange for the promise of one thousand horses for her safe return, Moro's wife tells her that she has to remain in the temple of <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> with the other Khals' widows for the remainder of her days and become a <entidade:Dosh Khaleen>Dosh</entidade> khaleen.

<entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> helps Doran get to his wheelchair, as they both reminisce about <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>, with Doran stating how he envied his late brother for the adventurous life he led. <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> states that Doran would have made a bad adventurer, while <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> would have been a bad ruler. After settling into his chair, <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Caleotte>Caleotte</entidade> brings him a message that Myrcella has died. Before he can give an order, <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> stabs <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade> in the back, killing him, while <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> stabs Doran in the chest. As he lies on the floor, his guards do nothing, indicating they have sided with <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade>. As she twists her knife into Doran, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> angrily says he remained passive despite the brutal deaths of both his sister and brother, and that the people of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> are with her, now. As he is gasping, Doran begs <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> to spare Trystane, but <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> coldly scoffs at him. Doran then dies in a pool of his own blood.

 In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>

Cersei is sitting alone in her room, when a servant enters and announces that a ship from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> has arrived.

Meanwhile, Margaery is still imprisoned by the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade>, and the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> comes to visit her. She asks about her brother, <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>, but he tells her that she has to confess first. When she admits that nobody is perfect without sins, he tells her that she is on the right path but still has a long way to go.
<entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> and Nymeria arrive on <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> Trystane's ship, announcing their intention to kill him. Nymeria offers Trystane the choice of which one of the <entidade:Sands>Sands</entidade> he'd like to fight, and he chooses Nymeria, only for <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> to impale him through the back of his head with her spear as he turns his back on her.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, the mutineers have left Jon's body where he fell. <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> is scratching at the door in grief and howling, which gets the attention of several people, including <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade>, who leaves his room to investigate. Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> finds Jon's dead body just before Edd and some other brothers arrive. They take the body inside where Edd clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing Jon's eyes. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> asks if Edd trusts any of his brothers, and Edd replies, "The ones in this room." <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> convinces Edd to go bring <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> in, deciding that they need all the help they can get. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> arrives, stating she saw Jon fighting in <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> in the flames. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> and the black brothers doubt the dead Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> could do such a thing and she returns to her room.

Most of the brothers come to understand them and side with the mutineers. Back inside the room, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> notes Thorne is sure to have made his move by now. In response, Edd states he doesn't care because Jon was his friend and they butchered him, then he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out Thorne in revenge. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> responds they are hopelessly outnumbered, stating <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> isn't enough when Edd brings him up, before reminding them there are others nearby who owe Jon their lives. Realizing he means the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade>, Edd instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help.
All members of the Watch are shown bearing arms toward the room where Jon's body is being guarded by Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> and the men loyal to <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>. Thorne and senior members of the Watch approach the room and Thorne speaks to Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> through the locked door. Thorne promises full amnesty for the members of the Watch. To Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes, and that he can take <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> with him. Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> mocks what he knows to be an insincere offer by requesting mutton. Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> tells Thorne he is a poor hunter and does not want to starve, so he needs some mutton for his trip. Thorne promises him food will be provided. Ser Thorne says the offer is available as long as everyone in the room surrenders, and does so by sundown.

    <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> without her magical glamor of youth.  
<entidade:Alone>Alone</entidade> in her bedroom, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> appears despondent and looking as if she has been betrayed or led astray by The Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. <entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> a table next to her bed are various containers, some small that contain potions and other liquids. She unbuttons the front of her dress showing a young beautiful body. She then removes the dress completely and stands nude before a mirror. When she removes her large necklace the gem loses its glow. In the mirror, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be, a frail old woman with sagging breasts, leathery skin and thin wispy white hair. Fully nude, with her head bowed down in a despondent manner, she slowly climbs into bed and pulls the fur blanket on top of her.
