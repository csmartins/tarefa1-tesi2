<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> trains with the Three-Eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade>. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> advises <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> demands good news, but has to make his own. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> stands behind <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade>. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> proposes a plan, and <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> entertains other proposals.

<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> continues his training under the Three-Eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade> at the tree. He is shown a scene from <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, watching his father and Uncle <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen</entidade> training in the yard as young boys. He also sees his <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Aunt Lyanna</entidade>, <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> Nan, and Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik Cassel</entidade>. He also sees a stableboy that he realizes is a young <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> - and is surprised that in his youth he was not a lackwit but was intellectually normal and could talk, and his real name is actually "Wylis". Though <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> wants to stay, he is dragged out of the vision by the Three-Eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade>, who warns him that it is dangerous to stay too long in such visions. Outside the tree, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> finds <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera Reed</entidade>, who still appears to be in mourning over her brother's death. Though <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> questions the point of her presence during Bran's training, <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade> states that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> will need her when he leaves the tree.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> a tavern, a man drunkenly boasts of having taunted <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> during her walk of atonement to the great amusement of the other patrons. After he finishes his story, he leaves the tavern to urinate against a wall outside. As he is urinating, he is confronted by Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Clegane</entidade>, who kills him by smashing his head against the wall. Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> returns to Cersei's side following the murder.
Myrcella's funeral is held at the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Septa Unella>Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> but <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> cannot attend. <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> has ordered that <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> be confined to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> since he is concerned that the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> will re-arrest her if she steps inside the sept. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the sept, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> talk about <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> and <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade>. <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> believes that <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is to blame for <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> Trystane's death but tells <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> that he isn't upset with her. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> convinces <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> to go see his mother and apologize to her as the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> enters the sept. <entidade:After Tommen>After Tommen</entidade> leaves, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> begins threatening the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> and asks him why <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is being punished for her sins, but he isn't, considering he murdered the king he vowed to protect. As <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is about to kill the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade>, the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> seems to be unafraid to die, which confuses <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> explains that if <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> chooses to kill him then many of the sparrows will die fighting him, but it wouldn't really matter since they have no names or individual power. He says that they mean nothing individually, but together they can overthrow an empire.
<entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> visits <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> and apologizes for not being more assertive during her imprisonment. He regrets letting the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> lock her away and says that he should have torn the sept down with the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> inside of it. He tells her that he needs her help in being a strong ruler. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> remains uncharacteristically silent throughout the exchange, but when <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> is done speaking, she embraces him.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> 
<entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> tell <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade> and <entidade:Viserion>Viserion</entidade> have not been eating ever since <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> left. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> explains that dragons do not do well in captivity and they will probably start eating again if they are unchained. He also suggests that dragons are intelligent enough to remember their friends, and that they will probably not harm <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> if they meet her again, since she spent so much time with them when they were little. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> go down below the pyramid, with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> advancing into the darkness alone. One of the dragons emerges from the shadows and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> maintains eye contact. When the other emerges, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> puts down his torch and gently advances. To calm them, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> speaks gently, explaining that some say that dragons are more intelligent than humans, and tells about about a time when he was little and had asked his uncle for a dragon – not even a large one, just a little one like him. They all laughed, then Tyrion's father told him dragons were extinct, and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> says he cried himself to sleep that night. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> this point, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is finally close enough to release the locking pin on the second dragon's collar. The other advances on him, then gingerly turns his head to the side so <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> can free him as well. The dragons retreat, and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> hastily returns to <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> instructs <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> to punch him if he ever suggests doing anything like that again.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade>
Still a beggar on the streets, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is again approached by the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>, who asks her name. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> says she is "no one", at which the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> hits her. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> retorts that she doesn't believe that and neither does <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>. She tries to fight back, but the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> vanishes, replaced with <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar. He promises that if she says her name, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> will sleep under a roof that night, that she will eat, and he will restore her eyes. Each time however <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> says she has no name. <entidade:Satisfied>Satisfied</entidade>, he tells <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> to follow him, and that she is a beggar no more.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> and <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> discuss plans with Harald <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> regarding what to do about <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>. After <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> suggests storming <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> warns <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> that such an action would turn the entire <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> against <entidade:House Bolton>House Bolton</entidade>, adding that if he does not act more sensibly he will be discarded. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> that point, <entidade:Order of Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Wolkan>Wolkan</entidade> enters and announces that Roose's wife, <entidade:Walda Bolton>Walda</entidade>, has given birth to a baby boy. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade>, realizing that his position is weaker than ever, stabs his father to death and, in his position as the new <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>, he personally feeds <entidade:Walda Bolton>Walda</entidade> and his half-brother to the hounds.
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the woods, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> fills <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> in on her encounter with <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, whilst <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is reluctant to talk about her experiences under <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> Bolton's tyranny at <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>. She admits that she ought to have accepted her help sooner. Then Theon, wracked with guilt over his betrayal of the <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> family, decides to leave the group and go home. He tells <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> that <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Pod</entidade> will do a better job of looking after her, though he tearfully states that he would have gone with her all the way to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> if necessary. He asks to take one of the horses with him, and the two share an embrace.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Iron Islands>Iron Islands</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>, it is a dark and stormy night. <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara Greyjoy</entidade> reads a letter to <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> about how <entidade:Glover>Glovers</entidade> retook <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Deepwood Motte</entidade> and killed all of the <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> who held the castle. <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara</entidade> notes that their invasion is now a definite failure since <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Deepwood Motte</entidade> was the last stronghold that the <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> held in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> tells her that they will continue fighting, but <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara</entidade> argues that invading the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> is pointless since they are unable to hold the strongholds they conquer against the mainland armies and the strongholds in the mainlands aren't really valuable to the <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> because they are so far away from the sea. <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> says that one of the reasons that the invasion wasn't successful was because <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara</entidade> wasted men when she attempted to rescue Theon, which she says she will not apologize for. <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara</entidade> continues to try to convince <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> to end the rebellion, saying the only reason they were able to take strongholds in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> in the first place was because the <entidade:Northeners>Northerners</entidade> were in the south fighting a war, and now that war is over. She reminds <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> that the last time they provoked the <entidade:Northeners>Northerners</entidade> too far they were crushed and her two oldest brothers were killed. <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> tells her that when she rules she can be content with their current standing, but for now she needs to obey his commands or he will make another heir who will.
<entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> starts walking on the swinging rope bridge that separates two of the towers of <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>. Through the storm, he sees a man standing on the bridge who is blocking his way. He tells the man to get out of the way, but the man reveals himself to be Balon's younger brother, <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron</entidade> <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>. <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> tells him that he's surprised that he's still alive, and <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron</entidade> mocks the <entidade:Drowned God>Drowned God</entidade>, telling <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> that he is the <entidade:Drowned God>Drowned God</entidade>. <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> explains that he heard a rumor that <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron</entidade> lost his senses during a storm and his crew had to tie him to the mast of the ship to prevent him from jumping overboard. <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron</entidade> doesn't deny the rumor, and explains to <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> that he cut the tongues out of all of his crew members because he wanted silence. <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron</entidade> then says that <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> is too old to rule and that he's been ruling long enough and it's someone else's turn. <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> tells <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron</entidade> that he isn't a true <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> because he lost his wits during a thunderstorm and tries to stab him, but <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron</entidade> throws him off the rope bridge to his death.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Balon's funeral, <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara</entidade> tells the priest, <entidade:Aeron Greyjoy>Aeron Greyjoy</entidade>, Balon's youngest brother, that she will find the person who did this and feed them to sharks while they're still alive. She swears to do this upon the Salt <entidade:Iron Throne>Throne</entidade> and <entidade:Aeron Greyjoy>Aeron</entidade> explains to her that she isn't the ruler yet, because the law says that the <entidade:Kingsmoot>Kingsmoot</entidade> chooses the next ruler. <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara</entidade> argues that her father wanted her to rule, but <entidade:Aeron Greyjoy>Aeron</entidade> says that he doesn't make the law.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, nightfall has arrived and the band of black brothers loyal to <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> have not yet surrendered. When <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> refuses a final ultimatum from Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade>, the acting <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> orders the door to be battered down with a sledgehammer. Before the mutineers can break in, however, <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> returns with <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund Giantsbane</entidade> and an army of wildlings. Though <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> demands that the watchmen stand and fight, they are intimidated into surrender by the giant, <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, enabling an almost bloodless takeover. One archer shoots an arrow into Wun Wun's back, which has no effect upon the giant other than to cause <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade> to grab the archer off his perch and smash his skull against a wall. The watchmen, seeing this, quickly throw down their arms and surrender. <entidade:North Edit>No</entidade> wildlings are hurt.
Thorne, plus <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> and the officers who mutinied alongside him, are led away to the <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice Cells</entidade>. As <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> inspects Jon's corpse, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> visits <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>, who has donned her normal glamor but is still gripped by a crisis of faith. When he asks her if reviving <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is possible, she admits to having seen it done, but insists that she cannot do it, having lost faith in the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> due to the failure of her predictions regarding <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> to come true. After <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> implores her simply to try, she agrees. After washing Jon's wounds clean and burning his hair, she attempts to revive him using murmured High <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> incantations, but it seems they have no effect. After a moment, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> leaves, and <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> offers a final "please" in the <entidade:Common Tongue>Common Tongue</entidade>, but leaves the room, despondent. <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> and finally <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> follow her a moment later. Once the room is empty however, <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade>, who had been sleeping underneath the table upon which <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> was lying, perks up, and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> suddenly awakens, gasping for air.
