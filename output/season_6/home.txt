In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, Jaime advises Tommen. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> demands good news, but has to make his own. At <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> stands behind Thorne. Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> proposes a plan, and <entidade:Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> entertains other proposals.


<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> continues his training under the <entidade:Three-Eyed <entidade:Three-Eyed Raven>Raven</entidade>>Three-Eyed <entidade:Three-Eyed Raven>Raven</entidade></entidade> at the tree. He is shown a scene from <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, watching his father and <entidade:Uncle Benjen>Uncle Benjen</entidade> training in the yard as young boys. He also sees his <entidade:Aunt <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade>>Aunt <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Old Nan>Old Nan</entidade>, and <entidade:Ser Rodrik>Ser Rodrik</entidade> Cassel. He also sees a stableboy that he realizes is a young Hodor - and is surprised that in his youth he was not a lackwit but was intellectually normal and could talk, and his real name is actually "Wylis". Though <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> wants to stay, he is dragged out of the vision by the <entidade:Three-Eyed <entidade:Three-Eyed Raven>Raven</entidade>>Three-Eyed <entidade:Three-Eyed Raven>Raven</entidade></entidade>, who warns him that it is dangerous to stay too long in such visions. <entidade:Outside>Outside</entidade> the tree, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> finds Meera <entidade:House Reed>Reed</entidade>, who still appears to be in mourning over her brother's death. Though Meera questions the point of her presence during <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s training, <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade> states that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> will need her when he leaves the tree.

At <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
In a tavern, a man drunkenly boasts of having taunted Cersei during her walk of atonement to the great amusement of the other patrons. After he finishes his story, he leaves the tavern to urinate against a wall outside. As he is urinating, he is confronted by Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, who kills him by smashing his head against the wall. <entidade:Ser Gregor>Ser Gregor</entidade> returns to Cersei's side following the murder.
Myrcella's funeral is held at the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> but Cersei cannot attend. Tommen has ordered that Cersei be confined to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> since he is concerned that the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade> will re-arrest her if she steps inside the sept. In the sept, Jaime and Tommen talk about Myrcella and <entidade:Prince Trystane>Prince Trystane</entidade>. Tommen believes that Cersei is to blame for <entidade:Prince Trystane>Prince Trystane</entidade>'s death but tells Jaime that he isn't upset with her. Jaime convinces Tommen to go see his mother and apologize to her as the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> enters the sept. After Tommen leaves, Jaime begins threatening the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> and asks him why Cersei is being punished for her sins, but he isn't, considering he murdered the king he vowed to protect. As Jaime is about to kill the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade>, the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> seems to be unafraid to die, which confuses Jaime. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> explains that if Jaime chooses to kill him then many of the sparrows will die fighting him, but it wouldn't really matter since they have no names or individual power. He says that they mean nothing individually, but together they can overthrow an empire.
Tommen visits Cersei in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> and apologizes for not being more assertive during her imprisonment. He regrets letting the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> lock her away and says that he should have torn the sept down with the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> inside of it. He tells her that he needs her help in being a strong ruler. Cersei remains uncharacteristically silent throughout the exchange, but when Tommen is done speaking, she embraces him.

 In <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> 
Missandei and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> tell <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade>><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:Viserion>Viserion</entidade> have not been eating ever since Daenerys left. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> explains that dragons do not do well in captivity and they will probably start eating again if they are unchained. He also suggests that dragons are intelligent enough to remember their friends, and that they will probably not harm Missandei if they meet her again, since she spent so much time with them when they were little. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> go down below the pyramid, with <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> advancing into the darkness alone. <entidade:One>One</entidade> of the dragons emerges from the shadows and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> maintains eye contact. When the other emerges, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> puts down his torch and gently advances. To calm them, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> speaks gently, explaining that some say that dragons are more intelligent than humans, and tells about about a time when he was little and had asked his uncle for a dragon – not even a large one, just a little one like him. They all laughed, then <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s father told him dragons were extinct, and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> says he cried himself to sleep that night. At this point, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is finally close enough to release the locking pin on the second dragon's collar. The other advances on him, then gingerly turns his head to the side so <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> can free him as well. The dragons retreat, and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> hastily returns to <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> instructs <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> to punch him if he ever suggests doing anything like that again.

In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>
Still a beggar on the streets, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is again approached by the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>, who asks her name. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> says she is "no one", at which the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> hits her. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> retorts that she doesn't believe that and neither does <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>. She tries to fight back, but the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> vanishes, replaced with <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade>. He promises that if she says her name, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> will sleep under a roof that night, that she will eat, and he will restore her eyes. Each time however <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> says she has no name. <entidade:Satisfied>Satisfied</entidade>, he tells <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> to follow him, and that she is a beggar no more.

In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
At <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, Ramsay and Roose discuss plans with <entidade:Harald <entidade:Harald Karstark>Karstark</entidade>>Harald <entidade:Harald Karstark>Karstark</entidade></entidade> regarding what to do about Sansa. After Ramsay suggests storming <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, Roose warns Ramsay that such an action would turn the entire <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> against House <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, adding that if he does not act more sensibly he will be discarded. At that point, <entidade:Maester Wolkan>Maester Wolkan</entidade> enters and announces that Roose's wife, <entidade:Walda Bolton>Walda</entidade>, has given birth to a baby boy. Ramsay, realizing that his position is weaker than ever, stabs his father to death and, in his position as the new Lord <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, he personally feeds <entidade:Walda Bolton>Walda</entidade> and his half-brother to the hounds.
In the woods, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> fills Sansa in on her encounter with <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, whilst Sansa is reluctant to talk about her experiences under Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>'s tyranny at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. She admits that she ought to have accepted her help sooner. Then Theon, wracked with guilt over his betrayal of the Stark family, decides to leave the group and go home. He tells <entidade:Sansa that <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>>Sansa that <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade></entidade> and Pod will do a better job of looking after her, though he tearfully states that he would have gone with her all the way to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> if necessary. He asks to take one of the horses with him, and the two share an embrace.

In the <entidade:<entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Islands><entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Islands</entidade>
At <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>, it is a dark and stormy night. <entidade:<entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>><entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> reads a letter to King <entidade:Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> about how <entidade:Glovers>Glovers</entidade> retook <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Deepwood Motte</entidade> and killed all of the <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> who held the castle. <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> notes that their invasion is now a definite failure since <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Deepwood Motte</entidade> was the last stronghold that the <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> held in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. Balon tells her that they will continue fighting, but <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> argues that invading the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> is pointless since they are unable to hold the strongholds they conquer against the mainland armies and the strongholds in the mainlands aren't really valuable to the <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> because they are so far away from the sea. Balon says that one of the reasons that the invasion wasn't successful was because <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> wasted men when she attempted to rescue Theon, which she says she will not apologize for. <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> continues to try to convince Balon to end the rebellion, saying the only reason they were able to take strongholds in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> in the first place was because the <entidade:Northerners>Northerners</entidade> were in the south fighting a war, and now that war is over. She reminds Balon that the last time they provoked the <entidade:Northerners>Northerners</entidade> too far they were crushed and her two oldest brothers were killed. Balon tells her that when she rules she can be content with their current standing, but for now she needs to obey his commands or he will make another heir who will.
Balon starts walking on the swinging rope bridge that separates two of the towers of <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>. Through the storm, he sees a man standing on the bridge who is blocking his way. He tells the man to get out of the way, but the man reveals himself to be Balon's younger brother, <entidade:<entidade:Euron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Euron</entidade> <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>><entidade:Euron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Euron</entidade> <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>. Balon tells him that he's surprised that he's still alive, and <entidade:Euron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Euron</entidade> mocks the <entidade:Drowned God>Drowned God</entidade>, telling Balon that he is the <entidade:Drowned God>Drowned God</entidade>. Balon explains that he heard a rumor that <entidade:Euron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Euron</entidade> lost his senses during a storm and his crew had to tie him to the mast of the ship to prevent him from jumping overboard. <entidade:Euron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Euron</entidade> doesn't deny the rumor, and explains to Balon that he cut the tongues out of all of his crew members because he wanted silence. <entidade:Euron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Euron</entidade> then says that Balon is too old to rule and that he's been ruling long enough and it's someone else's turn. Balon tells <entidade:Euron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Euron</entidade> that he isn't a true <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> because he lost his wits during a thunderstorm and tries to stab him, but <entidade:Euron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Euron</entidade> throws him off the rope bridge to his death.
At Balon's funeral, <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> tells the priest, <entidade:<entidade:Aeron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Aeron</entidade> <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>><entidade:Aeron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Aeron</entidade> <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>, Balon's youngest brother, that she will find the person who did this and feed them to sharks while they're still alive. She swears to do this upon the Salt <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> and <entidade:Aeron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Aeron</entidade> explains to her that she isn't the ruler yet, because the law says that the <entidade:Kingsmoot>Kingsmoot</entidade> chooses the next ruler. <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> argues that her father wanted her to rule, but <entidade:Aeron <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Aeron</entidade> says that he doesn't make the law.

 At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
At <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, nightfall has arrived and the band of black brothers loyal to Jon have not yet surrendered. When Davos refuses a final ultimatum from <entidade:Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade>>Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade></entidade> Thorne, the acting <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> orders the door to be battered down with a sledgehammer. Before the mutineers can break in, however, Edd returns with <entidade:<entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane><entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane</entidade> and an army of wildlings. Though Thorne demands that the watchmen stand and fight, they are intimidated into surrender by the giant, <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, enabling an almost bloodless takeover. <entidade:One>One</entidade> archer shoots an arrow into <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>'s back, which has no effect upon the giant other than to cause <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade> to grab the archer off his perch and smash his skull against a wall. The watchmen, seeing this, quickly throw down their arms and surrender. No wildlings are hurt.
Thorne, plus <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> and the officers who mutinied alongside him, are led away to the <entidade:<entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade> Cells><entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade> Cells</entidade>. As <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> inspects Jon's corpse, Davos visits <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>, who has donned her normal glamor but is still gripped by a crisis of faith. When he asks her if reviving Jon is possible, she admits to having seen it done, but insists that she cannot do it, having lost faith in the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> due to the failure of her predictions regarding <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon to come true. After Davos implores her simply to try, she agrees. After washing Jon's wounds clean and burning his hair, she attempts to revive him using murmured <entidade:High Valyrian>High Valyrian</entidade> incantations, but it seems they have no effect. After a moment, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> leaves, and <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> offers a final "please" in the <entidade:Common Tongue>Common Tongue</entidade>, but leaves the room, despondent. Edd and finally Davos follow her a moment later. Once the room is empty however, <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade>, who had been sleeping underneath the table upon which Jon was lying, perks up, and Jon suddenly awakens, gasping for air.
