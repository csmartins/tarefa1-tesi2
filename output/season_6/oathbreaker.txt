<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
As <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> awakens and gasps for air, he slowly sits up and scans the room. He then looks down and is horrified by his stab wounds. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade>, having returned to the room, is shocked but relieved and quickly helps Jon as he struggles to walk. Davos asks Jon if he remembers anything. Jon, still shocked, says yes, he remembers getting stabbed by <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> and <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> for bringing the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> enters, shocked that the resurrection has worked. She then goes to Jon and asks him where he was after his death. Jon replies he saw nothing, much to <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s disappointment. Seizing on whatever hope she still has, however, she says that the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> brought Jon back for a reason; that Stannis was not The <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:That Was Promised>That Was Promised</entidade>, but "someone must be." Davos asks <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> to leave them alone so Jon can adjust to his revival.
After he has recovered somewhat, Jon dons his Night's Watch armor and the Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade>'s cape, and walks into the courtyard, seeing many of the fellow Brothers arrive before him. Jon, still struggling to walk properly, comes down and greets the dumbfounded Tormund. Tormund jokes with the resurrected Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> before hugging him tightly which slightly pains Jon due to his stab wounds. Jon then greets the relieved <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison Tollett</entidade> and they embrace.
Some time later, Jon oversees the public hanging of the traitors responsible for the <entidade:Mutiny>Mutiny</entidade> at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>: <entidade:<entidade:Bowen Marsh>Bowen</entidade> Marsh><entidade:Bowen Marsh>Bowen</entidade> Marsh</entidade>, <entidade:Othell <entidade:Othell Yarwyck>Yarwyck</entidade>>Othell <entidade:Othell Yarwyck>Yarwyck</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> and <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade>. Jon asks if any of the men have last words to say. <entidade:Bowen Marsh>Bowen</entidade> says Jon shouldn't be alive, stating it's not right. Jon coldly replies, "Neither was killing me." <entidade:Othell Yarwyck>Yarwyck</entidade> pleads Jon to tell his family in <entidade:White Harbor>White Harbor</entidade> that he died fighting the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade>. Alliser then says he had a choice: to betray his <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> or the Night's Watch. He then says that Jon bringing the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> was a dangerous problem and had to be stopped, and warns him that Jon will be fighting their battles forever.
Jon then moves on to <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade>, who says nothing and glares furiously at Jon. Jon reluctantly cuts down the rope, killing all four traitors. Jon looks at <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade>'s lifeless body. Afterwards, Jon takes off his cloak and hands it to the confused <entidade:Edd The>Edd</entidade>. Jon then says <entidade:Edd The>Edd</entidade> can do whatever he wants with the cloak, unofficially designating <entidade:Edd The>Edd</entidade> as the 999th Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the Night's Watch. Jon then leaves the courtyards and declares his watch has ended, leaving the rest of the Brothers look on in shock.

On a ship heading for <entidade:Oldtown>Oldtown</entidade>
<entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade>, <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade>, and her baby son Sam are sailing on a ship to <entidade:Oldtown>Oldtown</entidade>. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and Sam have never been on a ship before. Samwell is seasick and begins throwing up into a chamber pot. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> assures Samwell that it won't be long and says that she can't wait to see <entidade:Oldtown>Oldtown</entidade>. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> tells Tarly that the ship's captain says that <entidade:Oldtown>Oldtown</entidade> is the most beautiful city in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. While Samwell had originally planned to go and study at the <entidade:The Citadel>Citadel</entidade>, he changes his plans since he cannot bring <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and her child along as the <entidade:The Citadel>Citadel</entidade> only allows men within its walls.
Unwilling to abandon <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and Sam to the streets, Samwell decides to take them to his ancestral home of Horn Hill. While he does not get on with his father <entidade:Randyll Tarly>Randyll Tarly</entidade>, Samwell assures <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> that his mother and sister are very kind. Samwell wants to do everything to protect <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and her child from harm. Despite some unease, <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> promises to follow Samwell and let him decide what is best for them.

<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
Bran has a vision of the past again. He and the three-eyed raven are at the <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade> of Joy in <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, shortly after the end of Robert's Rebellion. The last two of the <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> stand before the <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade> and block the way of a small party of Northmen led by <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> himself. The three-eyed raven identified one of Ned's companions as <entidade:<entidade:Howland Reed>Howland</entidade> Reed><entidade:Howland Reed>Howland</entidade> Reed</entidade>, Meera's father. Eddard tells Ser <entidade:Arthur Dayne>Arthur Dayne</entidade> and Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Gerold Hightower>Gerold</entidade> Hightower><entidade:Gerold Hightower>Gerold</entidade> Hightower</entidade> to stand down, and asks why they weren't at the Trident. Ser Arthur states that Rhaegar ordered them here to guard the tower, so there they remained, even as Rhaegar and Aerys both died. Eddard asks where his sister Lyanna is, but Dayne simply wishes Stark the best in the wars to come. The two <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> draw their swords, with Ser Arthur saying, "And now it begins," to which Eddard replies "now it ends." The two sides clash, with Dayne making short work of a few of Ned's northmen. Ser Arthur slowly cuts down the number of northmen, but Ser <entidade:Gerold Hightower>Gerold</entidade> falls to Ned's blade. Eventually, Ser Arthur duels Eddard one-on-one. Bran expresses his shock at Ser Arthur's skills, with the three-eyed raven confirming that the <entidade:Sword>Sword</entidade> of the <entidade:Morning>Morning</entidade> is better than Ned. Dayne easily gains the upper hand and kicks Ned's sword away from him, but is unprepared for <entidade:Howland Reed>Howland</entidade> stabbing him through the back of the neck. Eddard seems visibly uncomfortable at winning this way, but unhesitatingly delivers the killing blow to the incapacitated Ser Arthur. Bran is shocked, as he had heard tales of this duel and never expected his father to stand for such things.
Eddard runs towards the tower, having heard a woman's scream come from one of its windows towards the end of the duel. Bran runs to follow Eddard, calling out, but he is told it's time to go by the raven. Ned looks back for a second, seemingly hearing Bran, but then runs into the <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade>. Bran tries to follow, but he is forced out of the past and back into the cave by the three-eyed raven, saying he had stayed in the past for too long. Bran is both angry and sad at this, but the raven asserts it was for his safety, and again sternly reminds him that the past cannot be changed. The raven further states that he's waited a thousand years for Bran to arrive, and that Bran will not share the raven's destiny. But before he can leave the cave, Bran must learn everything.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
    The "Little Bird" Spies  
<entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> is in the company of the little birds, children who used to spy for <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> tries to win the favor of the children by attracting them with candied plums from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>. Shortly afterwards, Cersei, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> and the reanimated Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade> enter. Cersei wants <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> to gather information from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, <entidade:Highgarden>Highgarden</entidade>, the North and wherever people are trying to take advantage of their losses and plotting against them.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> meeting, Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> Pycelle complains about <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> and his experiments. Ser <entidade:<entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, now <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King - is heading the Council – which now consists of himself, Pycelle, and Lord <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace Tyrell</entidade> – with <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna Tyrell</entidade> in attendance to lobby for Margaery and <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras Tyrell</entidade>'s release. Cersei, Jaime and Ser Gregor enter the room, startling Pycelle and Mace. On being questioned about what they are doing at a small council meeting, Cersei replies that she is the Queen, only to be corrected by Olenna that the rightful queen is the one married to the king and that Margaery is the one who fits that description. Jaime then argues that he, as Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, also has a right to attend. Pycelle admits that Ser <entidade:<entidade:Gerold Hightower>Gerold</entidade> Hightower><entidade:Gerold Hightower>Gerold</entidade> Hightower</entidade> once sat on the council, but dismisses this due to the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade>'s eccentricities. Cersei accuses <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> of not caring for her daughter Myrcella, while Jaime appeals to the bigger picture and urges <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> to take action against <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade> and the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> who have taken over <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> after eliminating <entidade:House Martell>House Martell</entidade>. Displeased with the newcomers, Ser <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> and the small council leave the hall.
Meanwhile, an angry King <entidade:<entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> and his <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> visits the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> to secure permission for Cersei to visit her daughter's resting place in the <entidade:<entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept</entidade>. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> replies that Cersei cannot visit because she still has not been cleared for the other sins that she is accused of. <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> criticizes the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> for his self-righteous treatment of Cersei after she had atoned for two of her crimes. Despite their differences, the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> claims admiration for the deep love that Cersei has for her son, <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>, which he attributes to the divine love of the <entidade:Mother>Mother</entidade>.
When <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> asks the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> why he wants to put his mother through more trials, the Sparrow replies that he is merely carrying out the will of the Seven. He urges the young King to turn to the Seven for wisdom. Before <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> leaves, less angry and more uncertain, the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> tells him that the Seven have worked through his grandfather and mother even though they may not acknowledge it. 

In Meereen
In the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Pyramid, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> holds court when the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> bring in <entidade:Vala>Vala</entidade>, a prostitute who is in league with the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>. She had seduced and murdered several members of the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> and <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>. <entidade:Vala>Vala</entidade> is defiant and states that she opposes the new regime imposed by the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> and <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> as illegitimate. She became a prostitute out of patriotic fervor for the old ways. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> assures <entidade:Vala>Vala</entidade> he has no interest in torturing her and decides to strike a deal. In return for revealing who is funding the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>, he offers her and her son safe passage on a ship bound for <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> with a bag of silver to start a new life. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> warns her that if she doesn't agree to the offer, she will be executed for her crimes, leaving her son orphaned.
Meanwhile, Tyrion passes the time by engaging <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> in small talk. Tyrion offers to play games with the pair but they are not interested. Before Tyrion can embark on a drinking game, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> returns and informs them that the <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise Masters</entidade> of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>, the <entidade:Good Masters>Good Masters</entidade> of <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>, and the Free <entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> of <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade> have been secretly funding the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>. While <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> advocates attacking the cities, <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> advises against it since that would leave Meereen unprotected. Using this information, Tyrion asks <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> to use his little birds to send them a message.

In the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> Sea
Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> walks with the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> towards <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> and is ushered into the the <entidade:Temple>Temple</entidade> of the <entidade:Dosh Khaleen>Dosh Khaleen</entidade> by <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal Moro</entidade>'s bloodriders. <entidade:Upon>Upon</entidade> entering the temple, the <entidade:High <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>High <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade> of the <entidade:Dosh Khaleen>Dosh Khaleen</entidade> orders the bloodriders to leave and strips her naked, giving her a robe which the dosh khaleen wear. As Daenerys puts on her new clothes, she tells the high priestess that she will soon regret what she has done as she was the wife of a great khal the Queen of Meereen, and the <entidade:Mother>Mother</entidade> of Dragons. The high priestess retorts that she herself was the wife of a previous <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Khal, <entidade:Savo>Savo</entidade>. Just as Daenerys thought she would conquer the world at Drogo's side, so did the high priestess think she would conquer the world at <entidade:Savo>Savo</entidade>'s. But <entidade:Savo>Savo</entidade> was slain, and she joined the dosh khaleen. She is now content, just as Daenerys would be if she is allowed to join them. When <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> expressed confusion, the priestess points out that khaleesi are supposed to return to <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> immediately after their khal's death... but Daenerys went out into the world. She explains that all the khalasars have gathered to decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved, and now they will have to decide what to do with Daenerys for not coming to the dosh khaleen after <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> died.

In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>
A blind <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade> resumes her training with the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>'ghar, the former of whom beats her repeatedly when she lies. Meanwhile, <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> has her mixing potions blindly. During her training, Arya continues sparring with the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> while answering questions about her family and the Hound. Arya admits to leaving the Hound to die instead of killing him, despite wanting his death. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> then interrogates Arya about the people on her list: Cersei, <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade> and <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade>. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> voices her disbelief that Arya's list is so short, but Arya counters by asking which name she wants added. When Arya insists that she is no one, the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> does not believe her and tries to hit her. However, Arya is able to deflect her blow and leap out of the way, surprising the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>. After confirming that Arya has mastered blind sparring, <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> approaches Arya and offers to give back her sight if she tells him her name. Arya replies that "a girl has no name." <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> then leads Arya to the well where he scoops up a bowl of water, which he offers her. She is reluctant, as others have drunk from it and died, but he says that if she is truly "no one" there is nothing to fear. Arya drinks from the bowl and her sight is restored. When <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> asks Arya who she is, she replies that she is no one.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> 
The <entidade:Umbers>Umbers</entidade> led by <entidade:Smalljon>Smalljon</entidade> <entidade:Umber>Umber</entidade> travel to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> to meet <entidade:Ramsay Bolton>Ramsay Bolton</entidade>, the new Lord of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> and <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the North. <entidade:Smalljon>Smalljon</entidade> and Ramsay chat about their experiences with their fathers. <entidade:Smalljon>Smalljon</entidade> mentions that his father <entidade:Greatjon>Greatjon</entidade> <entidade:Umber>Umber</entidade> is dead but admits that he would have killed him if the opportunity arose. Ramsay denies murdering the late <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose Bolton</entidade> and claims that he was poisoned by his enemies, but <entidade:Smalljon>Smalljon</entidade> doesn't bother believing him.
<entidade:Smalljon>Smalljon</entidade> has come to forge an alliance with the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> against <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> and the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade>. However, he refuses to bow to Ramsay; citing the late <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s betrayal at the hands of Roose. <entidade:Smalljon>Smalljon</entidade> then reveals that he has a "gift" for Ramsay, who asks if it is a girl, hoping for <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Smalljon>Smalljon</entidade> replies otherwise and <entidade:Umber>Umber</entidade> guards enter the room with two hooded figures. The first turns out to be <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> – the second is <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon Stark</entidade>, <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned Stark</entidade>'s youngest child. <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> and Rickon appear uncomfortable to find themselves in Ramsay's presence. When Ramsay asks <entidade:Smalljon>Smalljon</entidade> to verify Rickon's identity, an <entidade:Umber>Umber</entidade> retainer enters the room carrying the severed head of the direwolf <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade>, and Rickon's expression of dismay confirms this was his pet. <entidade:Satisfied>Satisfied</entidade>, a gleeful Ramsay then issues a sarcastic "welcome home Lord Stark."
