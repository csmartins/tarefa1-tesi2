In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
<entidade:Underneath>Underneath</entidade> the <entidade:<entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, <entidade:Septa Unella>Septa Unella</entidade> enters Queen <entidade:Margaery Tyrell>Margaery Tyrell</entidade>'s cell and leads her to a private meeting with the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade>. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> asks her what she would do if he allowed her to leave that day. Margaery replied that she wants to return to her family and her husband <entidade:<entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> respects her love for her family but tells her that attachment leads to sin, citing his experience as a cobbler. Margaery manages to impress the Sparrow with her knowledge of The <entidade:Book>Book</entidade> of the <entidade:Stranger>Stranger</entidade>, which she admits <entidade:Septa Unella>Septa Unella</entidade> had read at her. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> chuckles and agrees that Unella has a habit of reading at people instead of to them.
The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> recounts how in his youth he was a womanizer and drunkard. He underwent a conversion experience the morning after an orgy, as his drunken guests lay naked all around his house. Tired of what he was now perceiving as a meaningless existence, the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> then turned his life around and became a devoted member of the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> of the Seven. He then left his job as a cobbler and devoted his life to the poor and destitute. Believing he has found a way to reach Margaery, the Sparrow allows her to visit her brother <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras Tyrell</entidade>.

    Margaery remaining in her cell.  
She finds a dejected Loras lying on the floor of his cell. Loras has lost the will to continue resisting but Margaery tells him to stay strong because he is the future of <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade>. Loras tells them that he only wants his imprisonment to end and pleads with her to help him. Margaery tells Loras that the Sparrow is trying to use them to break each other and again tells him to stay strong.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> walks in on Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> Pycelle advising King <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> to accommodate the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> and the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade>. Cersei requests that Pycelle leave the room while she talks to her son alone under the pretext of meeting him for updates about the previous <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> meetings. During their conversation, <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> proposes that the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> not antagonize the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> further in order to avoid endangering Margaery's life. Cersei then reminds her son about the humiliation that she endured at their hands and exploits <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>'s love for Margaery. She convinces her son that the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> has no respect for kings, queens, and society. <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> then reveals a secret that the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> shared with him.
<entidade:Armed>Armed</entidade> with this new information, Cersei barges into a <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> meeting between <entidade:<entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna Tyrell</entidade>, and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>. While <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> and Olenna are initially hostile, Cersei convinces them to listen to her. She then informs the Council that the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> has planned to make Margaery do the walk of atonement. Olenna is horrified that the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> plan to debase her granddaughter. Jaime then urges the Council to allow the Tyrells to march their army into King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, crush the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade>, and bring Margaery and Loras back to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> into <entidade:Crown>Crown</entidade> custody. <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> says that <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> expressly forbid him to use the Lannister army he commands at the city to make a move against the <entidade:<entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept</entidade>, for fear that the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade> will harm Margaery in retaliation. Jaime suggests that Olenna send <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade>'s army to the city instead, and points out to his uncle that <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying, so <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> wouldn't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the Tyrell army arrives. The Tyrell army will surround the <entidade:<entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept</entidade>, intimidating the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> into releasing Margaery and Loras, without any blood actually being shed - and by the time <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> finds out what they've done he will already be happy with the outcome. <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade>'s interest is now turned, but he still expresses reluctance should they fail. Cersei is able to make him change his mind by exploiting his hatred towards the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> for taking his last remaining son and heir <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade>. Olenna agrees that blood will be shed no matter what they do at this point, so it's better if it's the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade>' blood and not theirs.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison Tollett</entidade> helps <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> pack up his things. <entidade:Edd The>Edd</entidade> scolds Jon for leaving the Night's Watch after taking an oath, to which Jon replies that he gave his life for the Night's Watch and can't trust his brothers. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> that moment, the horns sound for the arrival of travellers. <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of Tarth and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> ride through the gates and dismount in the courtyard. Jon rushes out and sees Sansa for the first time since the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> left <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> for King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, and they embrace. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night, they converse and reminisce on their childhood. Sansa proposes they take <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> back from <entidade:Ramsay Bolton>Ramsay Bolton</entidade> but Jon says he's done fighting, especially after hanging <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade>.

    Jon and Sansa are reunited at the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>.  
<entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> asks whether <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> will stay at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> and she replies she will do as <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>, The <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:That Was Promised>That Was Promised</entidade>, commands. Davos asks what happened to Stannis and she replies he was defeated in battle. When he asks about Shireen, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is reluctant to speak. Their conversation is interrupted by <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>, who recognizes Davos and <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> as Stannis' former entourage. Still bitter over the death of King <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly Baratheon</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> warns <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> that she does not forget or forgive. She also tells them that she executed Stannis after he admitted using blood magic to assassinate Renly.
Some time later, Jon receives a letter from <entidade:Ramsay Bolton>Ramsay Bolton</entidade> stating that he has <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon Stark</entidade> at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> and if Sansa is not returned, he will slaughter every <entidade:Wildling>Wildling</entidade> at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, let his men rape Sansa, and feed Jon and Rickon to his dogs. Tormund says he has 2,000 able fighters, far less than the estimated 5,000 Ramsay has. Sansa says that they have to try to retake their home and rescue their brother and that the houses of the North will unite behind Jon as the son of the true <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the North. Jon resolves to take Ramsay down.

In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>
    <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> practices his archery.  
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Runestone>Runestone</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> Arryn><entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> Arryn</entidade> trains at his archery in front of Lord <entidade:Yohn>Yohn</entidade> Royce. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> arrives with a retinue of Arryn guards and a pet falcon as a belated name-day gift. Royce reminds Baelish that he told him that he was taking Sansa with him to The <entidade:Fingers>Fingers</entidade>, but he received word that she had been married to <entidade:Ramsay Bolton>Ramsay Bolton</entidade>. Baelish tells him that on the way to The <entidade:Fingers>Fingers</entidade> they were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. A confrontation ensues, in which Petyr accuses Royce of giving away the information regarding the location of <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> to <entidade:House Bolton>House Bolton</entidade>. When Royce accuses Baelish of slander, Petyr reminds him that <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> is the Lord of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>, and asks for his judgment. <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> then asks Baelish if they should throw Lord Royce from the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>, which prompts the surrounding knights, including those loyal to Royce, to muster themselves. Royce swears his loyalty to <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade>, and he is let off without punishment on Baelish's recommendation. Royce comes onto the dark realization that <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> has control over <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade>. Petyr and <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> decide they have to muster the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> knights to march North and aid Sansa.

 In The North 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> is brought before <entidade:Ramsay Bolton>Ramsay Bolton</entidade>, who says that while her fellow captive <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon Stark</entidade> has value to Ramsay, he is unsure of her worth. <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> denounces the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>, saying that her servitude and loyalty to them were forced. She also attempts to seduce Ramsay, climbing onto his lap and kissing him, all the while trying to get the knife he had been using to peel apples. Ramsay seemingly falls for it, saying that it took much longer for him to get <entidade:Theon Greyjoy>Theon Greyjoy</entidade> over to his side but that Theon told him everything, including how <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> had seduced Theon in order to help Rickon and <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran Stark</entidade> escape <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> realizes that she has been lured into a trap, and tries to stab Ramsay, only for him to slash her throat. She dies shortly thereafter.

In the <entidade:Iron Islands>Iron Islands</entidade>
    Theon returns home.  
<entidade:Theon Greyjoy>Theon Greyjoy</entidade> returns home to <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>, where he learns of the death of his father, <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> Greyjoy. His sister, Yara, is unhappy about his return and his refusal to leave the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade> when she made an attempt to rescue Theon from <entidade:Ramsay Bolton>Ramsay Bolton</entidade>. Theon explains that Ramsay "broke him into a thousand pieces," which Yara affirms "yes, he sent us one of those pieces" referring to the box containing Theon's penis that she and <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> Greyjoy received. Yara then suspects that Theon has come back to declare himself King of the <entidade:Iron Islands>Iron Islands</entidade>, but he insists that he does not want the crown, instead wishing for Yara to rule, with him helping her in any way that he can.

In Meereen
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> along with <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade>, and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> meet with representatives of the <entidade:Good Masters>Good Masters</entidade> of <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>, the <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise Masters</entidade> of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>, and the slave-trading city of <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>; who have arrived by sea. As the diplomatic mission enters the harbor, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> advocates using military force. When Tyrion explains that he is able to empathize with slaves because he spent one day as a slave, <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> counters that he has not experienced slavery. The emissaries are Tyrion's former slave master <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> zo <entidade:Qaggaz>Qaggaz</entidade>, the <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>'i Wise Master <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> mo <entidade:Eraz>Eraz</entidade> and the <entidade:Volantene>Volantene</entidade> triarch <entidade:Belicho Paenymion>Belicho Paenymion</entidade>.

    <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, Tyrion and <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> converge to prepare for their meeting.  
In their meeting chambers, <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> marvels at how Tyrion went from being a nearly-worthless slave to the de facto ruler of Meereen. The slave-trading cities offer to give Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> and her mercenaries a large pot of money if they sail away from Slaver's Bay. When <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> defends Daenerys's actions in liberating slaves, <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> contends that slavery has existed for centuries. After hearing their offer, Tyrion proposes a counter-offer. He offers to give them a seven-year grace period to phase out slavery and to compensate slave owners, however they must end all backing for the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> (regardless of whether they admit this backing or not).  He then cautions them that they will not get a better offer. Tyrion then gives them time to consider his offer, though <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> and <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> insist on abolishing slavery.
Tyrion and his entourage are later confronted by a crowd of former slaves in the Meereen throne room. A freedman demands to know when Daenerys will return while another is appalled at the idea of Tyrion negotiating with slave traders. Tyrion insists he is doing his best to rule the city in Daenerys's absence. The freedmen do not trust Tyrion, a foreigner and a newcomer, and look to <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> and <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> for reassurance. Despite their misgivings, they both publicly back Tyrion's diplomacy in front of the freedmen. In private, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> and <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> warn Tyrion that the masters will outmaneuver him, despite his best efforts to do the same to them.

In <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>
Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade> approach the outskirts of <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> and discard their weapons, as drawing a blade in the city is considered sacrilege. <entidade:Within>Within</entidade> the city itself, Jorah and Daario run afoul of <entidade:Akho>Akho</entidade> and <entidade:Iggo>Iggo</entidade> who see through Jorah's claims to be a wine merchant. Daario takes care of <entidade:Iggo>Iggo</entidade> while <entidade:Akho>Akho</entidade> tackles Jorah. The knight is nearly undone, but Daario saves him at the last minute with the stiletto he smuggled in. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Jorah's insistence, Daario smashes <entidade:Aggo>Aggo</entidade>'s skull with a rock so that no one will think he was killed with a bladed weapon.

    <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> proves to the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> who their true <entidade:Khaleesi>Khaleesi</entidade> is.  
Meanwhile, the <entidade:High <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>High <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade> of the <entidade:Dosh Khaleen>Dosh Khaleen</entidade> gives Daenerys a commentary on the other crones. Some of them hate Daenerys, thinking the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> should not interbreed with other races, but the high priestess dismisses them, saying that the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> have always interbred and have never been concerned with blood purity. To illustrate her point, the high priestess indicates another of the khaleen, a <entidade:Lhazareen>Lhazareen</entidade> girl (<entidade:Ornela>Ornela</entidade>) taken from her village at the age of twelve. Daenerys asks to relieve herself, and the high priestess sends <entidade:Ornela>Ornela</entidade> with her. As they walk, Daenerys learns that <entidade:Ornela>Ornela</entidade>'s khal died when she was only sixteen. The pair are interrupted by Jorah and Daario, who take the <entidade:Lhazareen>Lhazareen</entidade> hostage. Daenerys, unsurprised to see them, cancels their plans for escape – they have a slim chance of leaving <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>, let alone getting back to Meereen – and tells them that she has a plan of her own. She asks <entidade:Ornela>Ornela</entidade> if she is willing to help them, calling her a <entidade:Khaleesi>Khaleesi</entidade> (queen) instead of a khaleen (crone). The girl reluctantly agrees.
During the <entidade:Khalar>Khalar</entidade> vezhven, the khals argue about how to deal with <entidade:Iggo>Iggo</entidade> and <entidade:Akho>Akho</entidade>'s deaths; <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal Moro</entidade> defuses the situation by reminding them that Ahko was a member of his khalasar, and he does not care about finding the killer if he was stupid enough to get himself killed. Daenerys is then brought in by the two priestesses she befriended before. Moro insists that she join the dosh khaleen, but another khal expresses interest in making her his khaleesi, while another suggests giving her to the <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise Masters</entidade> in exchange for ten thousand horses. Daenerys dismisses all of them; she claims that they are all petty and weak, and reminds them that <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> was willing to cross the "poison water" in "wooden horses" for his conquests.

    Jorah and Daario bow down to their queen.  
Stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade>, Daenerys declares that she will lead them herself. After a pause, Moro and the khals burst into laughter. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> reminds them that her husband, in the same temple in which they all now sit, declared that he would lead a <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> army across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> to retake the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> for his khaleesi and that all the khals have done since is to raid and plunder villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest. <entidade:Disgusted>Disgusted</entidade> with her insolence, Moro declares that she will be raped by each of the khals, then by all of their bloodriders, and then, if she is still alive, by their horses. Daenerys is unfazed by the threats, as she knocks down the braziers in the hut, setting everything aflame. The khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly-spreading fire, only to find the temple's only door barred, the bodies of the two men guarding it lying dead outside.
As the flames climb higher, the dosh khaleen and khalasars gather in confusion. Eventually, the doors collapse and Daenerys emerges, naked and unburned, with the entire leadership present at <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> dead. Many of the assembled bow immediately, with the high priestess and the rest of the dosh khaleen following after a moment. Jorah and Daario move to the front of the crowd and bow last.
