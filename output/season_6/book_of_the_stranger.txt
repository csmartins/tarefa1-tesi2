In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
Underneath the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, <entidade:Septa Unella>Septa Unella</entidade> enters <entidade:Queen Margaery>Queen Margaery</entidade> Tyrell's cell and leads her to a private meeting with the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade>. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> asks her what she would do if he allowed her to leave that day. Margaery replied that she wants to return to her family and her husband <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen Baratheon</entidade>. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> respects her love for her family but tells her that attachment leads to sin, citing his experience as a cobbler. Margaery manages to impress the <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade> with her knowledge of The <entidade:Book>Book</entidade> of the <entidade:Stranger>Stranger</entidade>, which she admits <entidade:Septa Unella>Septa Unella</entidade> had read at her. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> chuckles and agrees that Unella has a habit of reading at people instead of to them.
The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> recounts how in his youth he was a womanizer and drunkard. He underwent a conversion experience the morning after an orgy, as his drunken guests lay naked all around his house. <entidade:Tired>Tired</entidade> of what he was now perceiving as a meaningless existence, the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> then turned his life around and became a devoted member of the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> of the Seven. He then left his job as a cobbler and devoted his life to the poor and destitute. Believing he has found a way to reach Margaery, the <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade> allows her to visit her brother <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras Tyrell</entidade>.

    Margaery remaining in her cell.  
She finds a dejected Loras lying on the floor of his cell. Loras has lost the will to continue resisting but Margaery tells him to stay strong because he is the future of <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade>. Loras tells them that he only wants his imprisonment to end and pleads with her to help him. Margaery tells Loras that the <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade> is trying to use them to break each other and again tells him to stay strong.
At the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> walks in on Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> advising <entidade:King Tommen>King Tommen</entidade> to accommodate the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> and the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade>. Cersei requests that <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> leave the room while she talks to her son alone under the pretext of meeting him for updates about the previous Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade> meetings. During their conversation, Tommen proposes that the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> not antagonize the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> further in order to avoid endangering Margaery's life. Cersei then reminds her son about the humiliation that she endured at their hands and exploits Tommen's love for Margaery. She convinces her son that the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> has no respect for kings, queens, and society. Tommen then reveals a secret that the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> shared with him.
Armed with this new information, Cersei barges into a Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade> meeting between <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna Tyrell</entidade>, and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>. While Kevan and Olenna are initially hostile, Cersei convinces them to listen to her. She then informs the <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade> that the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> has planned to make Margaery do the walk of atonement. Olenna is horrified that the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> plan to debase her granddaughter. Jaime then urges the <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade> to allow the <entidade:Tyrells>Tyrells</entidade> to march their army into <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, crush the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade>, and bring Margaery and Loras back to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> into <entidade:Crown>Crown</entidade> custody. Kevan says that Tommen expressly forbid him to use the Lannister army he commands at the city to make a move against the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade>, for fear that the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade> will harm Margaery in retaliation. Jaime suggests that Olenna send <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade>'s army to the city instead, and points out to his uncle that Tommen only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying, so Kevan wouldn't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the Tyrell army arrives. The Tyrell army will surround the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade>, intimidating the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> into releasing Margaery and Loras, without any blood actually being shed - and by the time Tommen finds out what they've done he will already be happy with the outcome. Kevan's interest is now turned, but he still expresses reluctance should they fail. Cersei is able to make him change his mind by exploiting his hatred towards the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> for taking his last remaining son and heir <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade>. Olenna agrees that blood will be shed no matter what they do at this point, so it's better if it's the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade>' blood and not theirs.

At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
At <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison</entidade> Tollett><entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison</entidade> Tollett</entidade> helps <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> pack up his things. Edd scolds Jon for leaving the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> after taking an oath, to which Jon replies that he gave his life for the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> and can't trust his brothers. At that moment, the horns sound for the arrival of travellers. <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> ride through the gates and dismount in the courtyard. Jon rushes out and sees Sansa for the first time since the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> left <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> for <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, and they embrace. Later that night, they converse and reminisce on their childhood. Sansa proposes they take <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> back from Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> but Jon says he's done fighting, especially after hanging <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade>.

    Jon and Sansa are reunited at the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>.  
<entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> asks whether <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> will stay at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> and she replies she will do as <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>, The <entidade:Prince That <entidade:Red Waste>Was</entidade>>Prince That <entidade:Red Waste>Was</entidade></entidade> Promised, commands. Davos asks what happened to <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> and she replies he was defeated in battle. When he asks about Shireen, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is reluctant to speak. Their conversation is interrupted by <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>, who recognizes Davos and <entidade:<entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> as <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>><entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> as <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade></entidade>' former entourage. Still bitter over the death of King <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly Baratheon</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> warns <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> that she does not forget or forgive. She also tells them that she executed <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> after he admitted using blood magic to assassinate Renly.
Some time later, Jon receives a letter from Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> stating that he has <entidade:<entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark><entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark</entidade> at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> and if Sansa is not returned, he will slaughter every <entidade:Wildling>Wildling</entidade> at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, let his men rape Sansa, and feed Jon and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> to his dogs. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> says he has 2,000 able fighters, far less than the estimated 5,000 Ramsay has. Sansa says that they have to try to retake their home and rescue their brother and that the houses of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> will unite behind Jon as the son of the true <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. Jon resolves to take Ramsay down.

In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>
    Robin practices his archery.  
At <entidade:Runestone>Runestone</entidade>, <entidade:Robin Arryn>Robin Arryn</entidade> trains at his archery in front of <entidade:Lord Yohn>Lord Yohn</entidade> Royce. <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> Baelish arrives with a retinue of Arryn guards and a pet falcon as a belated name-day gift. Royce reminds Baelish that he told him that he was taking Sansa with him to The <entidade:Fingers>Fingers</entidade>, but he received word that she had been married to Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>. Baelish tells him that on the way to The <entidade:Fingers>Fingers</entidade> they were set upon by a large force of <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> men. A confrontation ensues, in which <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> accuses Royce of giving away the information regarding the location of <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> to House <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>. When Royce accuses Baelish of slander, <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> reminds him that Robin is the Lord of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>, and asks for his judgment. Robin then asks Baelish if they should throw <entidade:Lord Royce>Lord Royce</entidade> from the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>, which prompts the surrounding knights, including those loyal to Royce, to muster themselves. Royce swears his loyalty to Robin, and he is let off without punishment on Baelish's recommendation. Royce comes onto the dark realization that <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> has control over Robin. <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> and Robin decide they have to muster the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> knights to march <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> and aid Sansa.

 In The <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
At <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> is brought before Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, who says that while her fellow captive <entidade:<entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark><entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark</entidade> has value to Ramsay, he is unsure of her worth. <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> denounces the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>, saying that her servitude and loyalty to them were forced. She also attempts to seduce Ramsay, climbing onto his lap and kissing him, all the while trying to get the knife he had been using to peel apples. Ramsay seemingly falls for it, saying that it took much longer for him to get <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> over to his side but that Theon told him everything, including how <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> had seduced Theon in order to help <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> escape <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> realizes that she has been lured into a trap, and tries to stab Ramsay, only for him to slash her throat. She dies shortly thereafter.

In the <entidade:<entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Islands><entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Islands</entidade>
    Theon returns home.  
<entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> returns home to <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>, where he learns of the death of his father, <entidade:Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>. His sister, <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade>, is unhappy about his return and his refusal to leave the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade> when she made an attempt to rescue Theon from Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>. Theon explains that Ramsay "broke him into a thousand pieces," which <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> affirms "yes, he sent us one of those pieces" referring to the box containing <entidade:Theon's>Theon's</entidade> penis that she and <entidade:Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> received. <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> then suspects that Theon has come back to declare himself King of the <entidade:<entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Islands><entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Islands</entidade>, but he insists that he does not want the crown, instead wishing for <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> to rule, with him helping her in any way that he can.

In <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>
<entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> along with <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>, Missandei, and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> meet with representatives of the <entidade:Good Masters>Good Masters</entidade> of <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>, the <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise Masters</entidade> of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>, and the slave-trading city of <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>; who have arrived by sea. As the diplomatic mission enters the harbor, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> advocates using military force. When <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> explains that he is able to empathize with slaves because he spent one day as a slave, Missandei counters that he has not experienced slavery. The emissaries are <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s former slave master <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> zo <entidade:Qaggaz>Qaggaz</entidade>, the <entidade:<entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>'i Wise Master <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade>><entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>'i Wise Master <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade></entidade> mo <entidade:Eraz>Eraz</entidade> and the <entidade:Volantene>Volantene</entidade> triarch <entidade:Belicho Paenymion>Belicho Paenymion</entidade>.

    <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Missandei converge to prepare for their meeting.  
In their meeting chambers, <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> marvels at how <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> went from being a nearly-worthless slave to the de facto ruler of <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>. The slave-trading cities offer to give <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> and her mercenaries a large pot of money if they sail away from <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay. When Missandei defends Daenerys's actions in liberating slaves, <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> contends that slavery has existed for centuries. After hearing their offer, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> proposes a counter-offer. He offers to give them a seven-year grace period to phase out slavery and to compensate slave owners, however they must end all backing for the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> (regardless of whether they admit this backing or not).  He then cautions them that they will not get a better offer. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> then gives them time to consider his offer, though <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> and Missandei insist on abolishing slavery.
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and his entourage are later confronted by a crowd of former slaves in the <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> throne room. A freedman demands to know when Daenerys will return while another is appalled at the idea of <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> negotiating with slave traders. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> insists he is doing his best to rule the city in Daenerys's absence. The freedmen do not trust <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, a foreigner and a newcomer, and look to <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> and Missandei for reassurance. Despite their misgivings, they both publicly back <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s diplomacy in front of the freedmen. In private, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> and Missandei warn <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that the masters will outmaneuver him, despite his best efforts to do the same to them.

In <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>
<entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade> approach the outskirts of <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> and discard their weapons, as drawing a blade in the city is considered sacrilege. Within the city itself, Jorah and Daario run afoul of <entidade:Akho>Akho</entidade> and <entidade:Iggo>Iggo</entidade> who see through Jorah's claims to be a wine merchant. Daario takes care of <entidade:Iggo>Iggo</entidade> while <entidade:Akho>Akho</entidade> tackles Jorah. The knight is nearly undone, but Daario saves him at the last minute with the stiletto he smuggled in. At Jorah's insistence, Daario smashes <entidade:Aggo>Aggo</entidade>'s skull with a rock so that no one will think he was killed with a bladed weapon.

    <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> proves to the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> who their true <entidade:Khaleesi>Khaleesi</entidade> is.  
Meanwhile, the <entidade:High <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>High <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade> of the <entidade:<entidade:Dosh Khaleen>Dosh</entidade> Khaleen><entidade:Dosh Khaleen>Dosh</entidade> Khaleen</entidade> gives Daenerys a commentary on the other crones. Some of them hate Daenerys, thinking the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> should not interbreed with other races, but the high priestess dismisses them, saying that the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> have always interbred and have never been concerned with blood purity. To illustrate her point, the high priestess indicates another of the khaleen, a <entidade:Lhazareen>Lhazareen</entidade> girl (<entidade:Ornela>Ornela</entidade>) taken from her village at the age of twelve. Daenerys asks to relieve herself, and the high priestess sends <entidade:Ornela>Ornela</entidade> with her. As they walk, Daenerys learns that <entidade:Ornela>Ornela</entidade>'s khal died when she was only sixteen. The pair are interrupted by Jorah and Daario, who take the <entidade:Lhazareen>Lhazareen</entidade> hostage. Daenerys, unsurprised to see them, cancels their plans for escape – they have a slim chance of leaving <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>, let alone getting back to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> – and tells them that she has a plan of her own. She asks <entidade:Ornela>Ornela</entidade> if she is willing to help them, calling her a <entidade:Khaleesi>Khaleesi</entidade> (queen) instead of a khaleen (crone). The girl reluctantly agrees.
During the <entidade:Khalar>Khalar</entidade> vezhven, the khals argue about how to deal with <entidade:Iggo>Iggo</entidade> and <entidade:Akho>Akho</entidade>'s deaths; <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal Moro</entidade> defuses the situation by reminding them that <entidade:Ahko>Ahko</entidade> was a member of his khalasar, and he does not care about finding the killer if he was stupid enough to get himself killed. Daenerys is then brought in by the two priestesses she befriended before. Moro insists that she join the dosh khaleen, but another khal expresses interest in making her his khaleesi, while another suggests giving her to the <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise Masters</entidade> in exchange for ten thousand horses. Daenerys dismisses all of them; she claims that they are all petty and weak, and reminds them that <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> was willing to cross the "poison water" in "wooden horses" for his conquests.

    Jorah and Daario bow down to their queen.  
Stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>, Daenerys declares that she will lead them herself. After a pause, Moro and the khals burst into laughter. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> reminds them that her husband, in the same temple in which they all now sit, declared that he would lead a <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> army across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> to retake the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> for his khaleesi and that all the khals have done since is to raid and plunder villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest. Disgusted with her insolence, Moro declares that she will be raped by each of the khals, then by all of their bloodriders, and then, if she is still alive, by their horses. Daenerys is unfazed by the threats, as she knocks down the braziers in the hut, setting everything aflame. The khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly-spreading fire, only to find the temple's only door barred, the bodies of the two men guarding it lying dead outside.
As the flames climb higher, the dosh khaleen and khalasars gather in confusion. Eventually, the doors collapse and Daenerys emerges, naked and unburned, with the entire leadership present at <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> dead. Many of the assembled bow immediately, with the high priestess and the rest of the dosh khaleen following after a moment. Jorah and Daario move to the front of the crowd and bow last.
