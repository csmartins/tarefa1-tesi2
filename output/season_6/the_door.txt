Tyrion seeks a strange ally. Bran learns a great deal. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> goes on a mission. Arya is given a chance to prove herself.

 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    Sansa refuses <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s offer.  
<entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> receives a message bearing the sigil of House Baelish, asking her to a meeting in Mole's <entidade:Town>Town</entidade>. <entidade:Accompanied>Accompanied</entidade> by <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>, Sansa furiously confronts <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade>, asking if he was aware what <entidade:Ramsay Bolton>Ramsay Bolton</entidade> was capable of. Baelish deflects, saying he has the knights of The <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> waiting at <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade> to aid Sansa. She is mistrustful of him when he claims he had no idea of Ramsay's abusive treatment of her. She doubts Baelish's ability to protect her or even himself, threatening to have <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> kill him. He says he'll do whatever she asks and Sansa tells him to leave and never come back for her. He obeys, but not before informing that her great-uncle <entidade:Brynden Tully>Brynden Tully</entidade> has recaptured <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> and recommending she seek him out and the remaining loyal Tully forces. Sansa says she already has an army, her brother <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>'s army of wildlings. "Half-brother," Baelish clarifies as he walks away, reminding her that Jon is only her half brother.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, a war council is called, and is attended by Sansa, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>, Podrick, Jon, Davos, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>, Tormund and <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison Tollett</entidade>, who discuss the need for more men to defend <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, since the <entidade:Karstarks>Karstarks</entidade> and <entidade:Umbers>Umbers</entidade>, two major Houses in the North, have declared for Ramsay. Jon points out that they can summon the rest of the minor Houses, such as the Mormonts, <entidade:Glovers>Glovers</entidade>, <entidade:Cerwyns>Cerwyns</entidade>, and <entidade:Mazins>Mazins</entidade>, to rival their enemies, and Sansa reveals Brynden's successful retaking of <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>, though she claims she learned via one of Ramsay's ravens in order to stop Jon from pursuing <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>. Sansa subsequently tasks <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick with securing Brynden's help while the rest of them leave <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> to start building their army. Before leaving <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, Sansa presents Jon with a new cloak like their father's, carrying the Stark sigil.

In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>
The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> continues to drill Arya, mocking her high-born origins. <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>’ghar explains that the <entidade:Faceless Men>Faceless Men</entidade> were slaves in Valyria before establishing the Free <entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> and the House of Black & White. Handing Arya a vial, <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> tells her an actress, <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Crane>Crane</entidade>, will be the next to receive the Many-Faced <entidade:Drowned God>God</entidade>’s “gift.”

    Arya watches The <entidade:Bloody <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>>Bloody <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade></entidade>, a stage-play in <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> loosely based on the recent civil wars in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>.  
Arya enjoys the spectacle of the actors re-enacting the <entidade:War>War</entidade> of the Five Kings, playing <entidade:Baratheons>Baratheons</entidade> and <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, but her pleasure ceases when her father, and his execution, are inaccurately caricatured. Eddard is portrayed as a buffoon, and the actress who plays Sansa has her breasts bared to the audience. Arya sneaks into the dressing room after the play to observe her target – the actress playing Cersei – who appears to be a clever, decent woman. Arya later shares with <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> her plan to poison <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Crane>Crane</entidade>’s rum, which no one else in the troupe drinks. Arya suspects that a jealous younger actress, <entidade:Bianca>Bianca</entidade>, has commissioned the kill. <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> cuts her off, reminding her a servant does not question.

 In the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> Sea 
    Jorah shows his arm to Daenerys.  
Daenerys is unsure of what to do with Jorah, having banished him twice, seeing him defiantly return twice, and him twice saving her life. Jorah finally confesses his love for Daenerys, but also reveals his spreading greyscale infection, and says that this time, he needs to leave for good. He starts to leave and states his plan to take his own life well before the greyscale envelops him, but Daenerys tearfully commands him to find a cure and come back to her side when she conquers <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. Jorah then departs while Daenerys and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade> lead the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> horde back to Meereen.

In Meereen
    <entidade:Kinvara>Kinvara</entidade>, the High <entidade:Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade>.  
While the rulers of Meereen enjoy a tenuous peace, Tyrion reminds them of the need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys's blessing, as the Masters could use Tyrion and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>'s foreign status against them to reclaim Slaver's Bay. To that end, Tyrion invites <entidade:Kinvara>Kinvara</entidade>, <entidade:High <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>High <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade> of the Red <entidade:Temple>Temple</entidade> of <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, to negotiate spreading the word of Daenerys's accomplishments. To Tyrion's surprise, <entidade:Kinvara>Kinvara</entidade> appears to be highly accommodating in supporting Tyrion's goals, as she firmly believes that Daenerys is The <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:That Was Promised>That Was Promised</entidade>. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> is more skeptical, being suspicious of any practitioners of magic, and points out that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> had already declared <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis Baratheon</entidade> to be the <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade>, only for him to be defeated twice. <entidade:Kinvara>Kinvara</entidade> says that while the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> has a plan, the humans following him do occasionally make errors. She then unnerves <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> by revealing that she knows <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> was emasculated by a "second-rate sorcerer" and offers to repeat the words he heard in the flames, and identify who it was that spoke. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> is uncharacteristically unsettled by this revelation. <entidade:Kinvara>Kinvara</entidade> then assures Tyrion that she will send the preachers and priests best suited to the task at hand.

In the <entidade:Iron Islands>Iron Islands</entidade>
As the <entidade:Kingsmoot>Kingsmoot</entidade> is held, <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara Greyjoy</entidade> is the first to lay claim to the <entidade:Salt Throne>Salt Throne</entidade>. Yara argues that raiding the mainland is not enough for their people, and that they need to use military force to teach the mainlanders a lesson. An <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> man challenges Yara's candidacy on the grounds that she is a woman and points out that her brother <entidade:Theon Greyjoy>Theon Greyjoy</entidade> has returned. Theon endorses his older sister and urges the gathering to do the same; stressing that she is a warrior, a reaver, and an <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade>. Many shout for Yara to be their Queen.
Before they can crown Yara, <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron Greyjoy</entidade> joins the gathering to lay claim to the <entidade:Salt Throne>Salt Throne</entidade>. He openly mocks Theon for his military failures and emasculation before deriding Yara as a woman. Yara in turn accuses Euron of killing their King and her father <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade>. To her surprise, Euron admits killing <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> but then defends his actions on the grounds that <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> was leading them to defeat in the North. When Euron states that his only regret is not killing <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> years earlier, he is met by resounding cheers from the crowd. Theon then counters that Euron had spent years gallivanting overseas while Yara was commanding <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> ships and men. Yara then suggests building a massive fleet to attack and make their mark on <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>.

    <entidade:Euron Greyjoy>Euron Greyjoy</entidade>, King of the <entidade:Iron Islands>Iron Islands</entidade>.  
In response, Euron announces that he also supports expanding the <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> fleet. Revealing a trick up his sleeve, he then proposes to marry Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> and then carry her army and dragons back to <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. The <entidade:Ironborn>Ironborn</entidade> support Euron's plan and declare him king. The <entidade:Drowned Men>Drowned Men</entidade> priest <entidade:<entidade:Aeron Greyjoy>Aeron</entidade> Greyjoy><entidade:Aeron Greyjoy>Aeron</entidade> Greyjoy</entidade> then leads Euron down to the sea to be drowned and reborn, as is the custom. Knowing that Euron will kill them as soon as he is able, Yara, Theon, and many of their loyalists flee the <entidade:Iron Islands>Iron Islands</entidade> during Euron's coronation, taking much of the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron Fleet</entidade> with them. After Euron revives himself, he is crowned by his brother <entidade:Aeron Greyjoy>Aeron</entidade>. After learning that his niece and nephew have fled with their best ships, Euron calls on his followers to build their own ships so that he may pursue the pair and kill them.

<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
The Three-eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade>  shows Bran a vision of a heart tree amid spirals of standing stones in a lush green valley. His vision shows <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade> and other <entidade:Children>Children</entidade> of the <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade> talking amongst themselves, then looking eagerly at a captive bound to the tree. <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade> approaches and forces a <entidade:Dragonglass>Dragonglass</entidade> dagger into the captive's chest. The captive screams, but does not die, instead becoming the first <entidade:White Walker>White Walker</entidade>.
Bran immediately confronts <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade> about creating the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> in the first place. <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade> tries to explain that they were at war with the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade> and were desperate. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, Bran is the only one in the cave awake and is anxious to warg back into the <entidade:Weirwood>Weirwood</entidade> tree. Bran wargs into the tree by himself and sees the <entidade:Army>Army</entidade> of the <entidade:Dead>Dead</entidade>. He slowly walks through the army until he comes to a space occupied by four <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, including the <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade>.  As Bran becomes aware that the The <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade> and the dead are now able to see him, the <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade> grabs his arm, branding him with an icy mark. He breaks out of the vision with a scream waking the others.  The Three-eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade> tells Bran, Meera and <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> that the <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade> is now able to locate Bran and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> and the wights out of the cave.  As a result, they must leave now and Bran must "become" the Three-eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade>. Bran asks whether he is ready, and the <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade> says "No" at which point Bran's eyes whiten as he enters another vision.
As Meera and <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> are preparing to leave they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible, indicating the arrival of the <entidade:Army>Army</entidade> of the <entidade:Dead>Dead</entidade> outside of the cave.  The <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade> and three <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> start marching towards the cave. The <entidade:Children>Children</entidade> of the <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade> try using magic projectiles to fend the Walkers off, but are overwhelmed. They light a fire around the entrance which prevents the wights from entering but the Walkers extinguish a pathway and walk through.  The wights end up climbing over the <entidade:Weirwood>Weirwood</entidade> and dropping through roots at the top of the cave. Meera desperately tries to get Bran out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> to carry Bran away to no avail. Using a dragonglass-tipped spear, Meera kills the first <entidade:White Walker>White Walker</entidade> that enters, and fights alongside the remaining <entidade:Children>Children</entidade> of the <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade> to try to fend off the wights until Bran wakes up. Wights begin to swarm the cave, killing all of the <entidade:Children>Children</entidade> of the <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade> except for <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade>, as Meera starts yelling at Bran to warg into <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>.
In the vision, Bran is at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> watching <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned Stark</entidade> say goodbye to his father, <entidade:<entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> Stark><entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> Stark</entidade>, before being sent to the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> as a ward. While still in the vision, Bran hears Meera's cries to warg into <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> and the Three-eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade> tells him to listen to her. Bran wargs into both the present-day <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> in the cave AND <entidade:Wylis>Wylis</entidade>, the young version of <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> in his vision.

    <entidade:Wylis>Wylis</entidade> seizing, as his words "hold the door" evolve into "<entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>".  
The <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> in the cave puts Bran's body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade> and Meera, as Bran's direwolf <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> is killed attacking the wights. As the wights are closing in on them, <entidade:Leaf>Leaf</entidade> sacrifices herself, using magic to cause a huge explosion, buying the other three enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel. While the Three-eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade> and Bran are still sharing a vision, the <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade> kills the Three-Eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade>, and his figure within Bran's vision blows away as ashes and rags.
With some difficulty <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> pushes the door open and pulls Bran through, coming back to help Meera close the door just as the wights approach. Meera grabs Bran's sled and tells <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> to bar the exit, shouting to "<entidade:Hold>Hold</entidade> the door!". <entidade:Inside Bran>Inside Bran</entidade>'s vision, <entidade:Wylis>Wylis</entidade> notices Bran, who links the present <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> to the past <entidade:Wylis>Wylis</entidade>. <entidade:Wylis>Wylis</entidade> begins to seize when he enters the mind of his future self. As Meera continues to yell "<entidade:Hold>Hold</entidade> the door!" to present-day <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>, within Bran's vision <entidade:Wylis>Wylis</entidade> falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure. Eventually, "hold the door" slurs into "<entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>," as his condition deteriorates and it becomes apparent this is the moment <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> lost the ability to say any other words, and his destiny was fixed.
Present-day <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> braces himself against the door long enough for Meera to disappear into the snow with Bran's unconscious body on the sled. Inevitably, the wights break through parts of the wood and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>. With no possibility of escape, all that is shown at the end is young <entidade:Wylis>Wylis</entidade> in the past seizing and crying out "<entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>."
