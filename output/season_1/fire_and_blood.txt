 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> has been executed by beheading; The great sword <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade> is covered in blood, and <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> standing next to Ser <entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn Payne</entidade>, the royal executioner, holds <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> Eddard's head up to the adulation of the baying crowd. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> has fainted. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the crowd, <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> drags <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> away, making a point of calling her "Boy". Once he gets her out of the courtyard, he cuts her hair off with a knife. He tells her that he will get her out of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and to <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> as a recruit of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>, but he warns her not to trust the other recruits, since apparently half would hand her over to <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> for a pardon, while the other half would do the same, but only after raping her first.
<entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is holding court and a singer is brought before him, charged with making up an amusing but offensive song about <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> and <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>. The song says that the boar might have killed <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade>, but the lion in his bed had previously castrated him. The singer turns out to be <entidade:Marillion>Marillion</entidade>, who <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik</entidade> met at the <entidade:Crossroads Inn>Inn</entidade> at the Crossroads, and who accompanied them and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to the <entidade:Vale Arryn>Vale</entidade> of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Arryn</entidade>. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> asks <entidade:Marillion>Marillion</entidade> if he wants to keep his hands or tongue. <entidade:Marillion>Marillion</entidade> fearfully responds that everyone needs hands. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> commands <entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn Payne</entidade> to cut out the tongue instead. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> then takes <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> up to the walls to see her father's head and makes her look at it. He cruelly mocks her, promising he will give her Robb's head next. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> quietly retorts that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> might give her Joffrey's instead. <entidade:Infuriated>Infuriated</entidade>, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> orders Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> to beat her, as <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> has told him that a king should not hit his queen. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> moves up behind <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>, apparently preparing to shove him off the walkway to his death, but unexpectedly <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> dabs the blood off her lip with a handkerchief and after <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> leaves, tells her to give him what he wants.

    <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> and <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>.  
<entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> has taken a new lover, her cousin <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> who was <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> Robert's squire. She also receives a letter informing her of Jaime's capture. <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> is naked in Cersei's bedroom. The thought of being at war is exciting to him, as he has just been made a new young knight. He asks for the news of the war and asks what their next move is, but <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> tells him to shut up and get back in bed.
Grand <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> takes the prostitute <entidade:Roslin Frey>Ros</entidade> to bed, revealing that he is actually far less frail than he appears. He boasts to <entidade:Roslin Frey>Ros</entidade> of the several great kings he has served, lamenting first how <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys Targaryen</entidade> devolved from a charming young man into a paranoid lunatic obsessed with fire, how <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> was a great soldier, but perhaps not so ideal a king, before displaying his sycophantic loyalty to <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>.

    <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>.   <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> has assembled a band of new recruits for the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>. Pretending that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is a boy called "Arry", he has her join the group. Also in the group are <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade>, <entidade:Lommy Greenhands>Lommy Greenhands</entidade>, and <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>, who unknown to him, is <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> Robert's bastard son. He had been working for <entidade:Tobho Mott>Tobho Mott</entidade>, but with <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> dead, the secret funds being sent to <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Mott</entidade> stopped, so he fired <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> and told him he had to join the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>. <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade> and <entidade:Lommy Greenhands>Lommy</entidade> try to bully <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> into giving up <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade>, but she angrily draws the sword, warning that she "has already killed one fat boy" and will happily do it again. <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> breaks up the argument by taking Arya's side, threatening the boys with violence to keep them from picking <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> later. <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> now has to get them all to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, a thousand leagues away, through the war-torn <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. They set out.
 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has another dream of the three-eyed raven. He wakes up and tells <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> about how the dream always ends with the bird flying into the crypts under the castle, and he tells her he thinks his father is in the tombs. <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> takes <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> down there, and <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> tells her about the histories of some of the ancestors entombed there. They are then surprised by <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade>, Rickon's direwolf, who leaps out at them from the empty future tomb of <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> calls <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade> off, then reveals to <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> that he had the same dream. Making their way out, <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> is still trying to tell <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> that it could be a coincidence, but outside they see <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade>, who holds a letter and looks at them with such sadness that it is obviously the news of Eddard's death.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> 
    <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> comforts her son, promising to avenge Eddard's death  <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Robb's camp, <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> stoically walks through the encampment and receives the condolences and respect of the northern bannermen, who bow to her as she passes. She makes her way into the woods around the camp.Â  Once she is out of everyone's sight, she breaks down, practically hyperventilating with grief. Hearing something from deeper in the woods, she finds <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> hacking his sword at a tree in anger and grief. <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> calls to him and tells him he is ruining his sword. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> drops the sword and falls into her arms, vowing to kill the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> who murdered his father. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> comforts him and promises him revenge, but only after they rescue <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> first.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Robb's camp, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> and his bannermen debate what to do in the war against <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>. They debate whether to align with <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> or <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>, but there is no agreement as <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> has greater forces, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is elder and next in line of succession (if Cersei's children are discounted). <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Umber>Umber</entidade> becomes irritated and questions why the northerners should be told what to do by rulers in the south at all, reminding them that the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> was once independent of the other <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Kingdoms</entidade> before the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> threatened them with their dragons. With the dragons gone, <entidade:Umber>Umber</entidade> declares there is only one king worthy of his respect and allegiance and bows before <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>, calling out, "The <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>!" The other northern bannermen take up the cry and bow before the new <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, swearing fealty to <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>.
<entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> visits the captive <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> who taunts her about Ned's death and offers to serve her as a lover. She hits him in the head with a rock. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> says that if she keeps hitting him, she can kill him and that he doesn't fear death, though <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> probably realizes that the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> won't kill him as long as his sister holds <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> hostage. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> tells him he has violated the laws of man and gods, and he asks where Ned's gods were when his head was cut off (he questions the existence of all gods, the <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> and the New). She says injustice in the world is because of men like him. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> responds, "There are no men like me, only me". He admits to pushing <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> from the tower, but doesn't reveal why.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade> camp, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is holding a strategy meeting with his generals, and is furious that <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> has been captured by the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>. Both <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> have claimed the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, meaning the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> are now faced with fighting a two-front war against the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> to the north and the <entidade:Baratheons>Baratheons</entidade> to the south. Tywin's commanders are uncertain what to do, arguing about whether to strike while they still can, fall back and raise reinforcement armies, or sue for peace. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> points out that any chance of negotiating with <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> died when his father <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> was executed. The <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade> army is now exposed, so <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> decides to retreat to <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, the great castle <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> the northern shores of Gods <entidade:Eye>Eye</entidade>, and use it as a base of operations. Reluctantly impressed by Tyrion's astute judgment of the situation, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> orders his son to go to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and serve as Acting <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> in Tywin's stead. He is to bring <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> and <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> to heel and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> also tells him to deal with <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade>, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, and <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> if he gets so much as a hint of treachery from any of them. He also orders <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to leave his whore behind. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> in his tent, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> complains about his father to <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, then decides to defy <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> and take <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> to court anyway.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> learns of his father's death. He saddles a horse and prepares to leave to join Robb's army, ignoring Samwell's pleas to stay and fulfill his oaths. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> leaves <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, but is pursued. One of his pursuers hits a tree branch and is unhorsed, and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> realizes it was <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade>. He turns back to help him. The other riders are <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> and <entidade:Pypar>Pypar</entidade>. He tells them to go back or they will get in trouble too, but they say they can't go back without him. They surround him and recite their oath to the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>, and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> realizes they are right: leaving would make him a deserter and oathbreaker, something his father would never countenance if he were alive, and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> doesn't even know if <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> would accept his help or turn him over to the authorities. He agrees to return to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> with them.
<entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> decides to overlook Jon's brief desertion, saying many have fled the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, only to think better of it and return. If they executed everyone who did that, they'd have no men left. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> tells <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that the war between the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> and <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> is less important than what they face now, a renewed threat from the wildlings, <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, and wights. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> means to lead the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> in force into the <entidade:Haunted Forest>Haunted Forest</entidade> to learn more of their foe, to prepare to battle against them, and to find the missing <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> agrees to commit himself fully to the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> and all that lies ahead.

 Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> 
    <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> regains consciousness.  <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the wastelands beyond <entidade:Lhazar>Lhazar</entidade>, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> wakes up to terrible news from Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade>. Her son, <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>, is dead. He was born dead and deformed, covered with scales. The majority of the khalasar has also moved <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade>, leaving them behind. However, <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> lives. DaenerysÂ insists <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> seeing her husband, and finds him a catatonic vegetable. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> demands to know why, andÂ Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> explains that when <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> "saved" her, she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>. They had sacked her village, looted all they owned, and those not killed were enslaved. She has now gotten her revenge, not only <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>, but <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> Daenerys' child Rhaego; now her "Stallion Who Mounts the World" can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents. <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> agrees that <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> saved her life, but she says to ask <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> what life is worth when all else is gone.
It is night, and <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> is in their tent tending to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>. She baths him, talks to him, even tries to seduce him, but nothing she does reaches him. She realizes he is no longer there, and seeing him in his vegetative state breaks her heart. Crying, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> kisses him goodbye, then smothers him with a pillow.
<entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> and her small retinue prepare a funeral pyre for <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>. She makes a speech to the few who are left saying that if they wish to go they may, but if they stay with her she will lead them into a glorious future. She frees those of them who are slaves and asks that they stay as equals. The maegi smirks as some people begin walking away. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Daenerys' command, <entidade:Rakharo>Rakharo</entidade> places the dragon eggs <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> the pyre, and Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> is tied to a stake next to the pyre as well. She tells <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> that she will not scream while she is burned alive. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> replies that she only wants the maegi's life. Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> believes that <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider, as they can sell the eggs and travel far away. Ignoring Jorah's pleas, she kisses his cheek, and sets the pyre alight. Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> does indeed scream as she burns, and <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> calmly walks into the flames. She stands below the pyre as flames appear to consume her.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> dawn, the fire dies down. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and the rest of the khalasar awake to find <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> sitting among the still smoldering embers, with three newly-hatched baby dragons crawling over her. Her clothes have burnt away and her body is covered in ash, but she is completely unharmed. One dragon nuzzles in her arm, another climbs her leg, and the third pulls itself up to sit <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> her shoulder. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the sight of the mythical animals born anew, an amazed <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and the few remaining <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> kneel and swear their allegiance to the <entidade:Mother>Mother</entidade> of Dragons. After she slowly stands up from the ashes, the black hatchling <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> her shoulder rises, spreads its wings and screams, announcing the return of dragons to the world.
