 In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Great Sept><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade> has been executed by beheading; The great sword <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade> is covered in blood, and <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> standing next to Ser <entidade:Ilyn Payne><entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn</entidade> Payne</entidade>, the royal executioner, holds Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s head up to the adulation of the baying crowd. <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> has fainted. In the crowd, <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> drags Arya away, making a point of calling her "<entidade:Boy>Boy</entidade>". Once he gets her out of the courtyard, he cuts her hair off with a knife. He tells her that he will get her out of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and to <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> as a recruit of the Night's Watch, but he warns her not to trust the other recruits, since apparently half would hand her over to Cersei for a pardon, while the other half would do the same, but only after raping her first.
Joffrey is holding court and a singer is brought before him, charged with making up an amusing but offensive song about Robert and Cersei. The song says that the boar might have killed King Robert, but the lion in his bed had previously castrated him. The singer turns out to be <entidade:Marillion>Marillion</entidade>, who Catelyn and Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik</entidade> met at the Inn at the Crossroads, and who accompanied them and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to the Vale of Arryn. Joffrey asks <entidade:Marillion>Marillion</entidade> if he wants to keep his hands or tongue. <entidade:Marillion>Marillion</entidade> fearfully responds that everyone needs hands. Joffrey commands <entidade:Ilyn Payne><entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn</entidade> Payne</entidade> to cut out the tongue instead. Joffrey then takes Sansa up to the walls to see her father's head and makes her look at it. He cruelly mocks her, promising he will give her Robb's head next. Sansa quietly retorts that Robb might give her Joffrey's instead. <entidade:Infuriated>Infuriated</entidade>, Joffrey orders Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> to beat her, as Cersei has told him that a king should not hit his queen. Sansa moves up behind Joffrey, apparently preparing to shove him off the walkway to his death, but unexpectedly <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> dabs the blood off her lip with a handkerchief and after Joffrey leaves, tells her to give him what he wants.

    <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> and Cersei.  
<entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> has taken a new lover, her cousin <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> who was King Robert's squire. She also receives a letter informing her of Jaime's capture. <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> is naked in Cersei's bedroom. The thought of being at war is exciting to him, as he has just been made a new young knight. He asks for the news of the war and asks what their next move is, but Cersei tells him to shut up and get back in bed.
Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> takes the prostitute Ros to bed, revealing that he is actually far less frail than he appears. He boasts to Ros of the several great kings he has served, lamenting first how <entidade:Aerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>>Aerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade></entidade> devolved from a charming young man into a paranoid lunatic obsessed with fire, how <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> was a great soldier, but perhaps not so ideal a king, before displaying his sycophantic loyalty to Joffrey.

    <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> and Arya.   <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> has assembled a band of new recruits for the Night's Watch. Pretending that Arya is a boy called "Arry", he has her join the group. Also in the group are <entidade:Hot <entidade:Hot Pie>Pie</entidade>>Hot <entidade:Hot Pie>Pie</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Lommy Greenhands><entidade:Lommy Greenhands>Lommy</entidade> Greenhands</entidade>, and <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>, who unknown to him, is King Robert's bastard son. He had been working for <entidade:Tobho <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Mott</entidade>>Tobho <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Mott</entidade></entidade>, but with Robert dead, the secret funds being sent to <entidade:Deepwood Motte>Mott</entidade> stopped, so he fired <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> and told him he had to join the Night's Watch. <entidade:Hot <entidade:Hot Pie>Pie</entidade>>Hot <entidade:Hot Pie>Pie</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:Lommy Greenhands>Lommy</entidade> try to bully Arya into giving up <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade>, but she angrily draws the sword, warning that she "has already killed one fat boy" and will happily do it again. <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> breaks up the argument by taking Arya's side, threatening the boys with violence to keep them from picking on Arya later. <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> now has to get them all to the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, a thousand leagues away, through the war-torn <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. They set out.
 In the North 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has another dream of the three-eyed raven. He wakes up and tells <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> about how the dream always ends with the bird flying into the crypts under the castle, and he tells her he thinks his father is in the tombs. <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> takes <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> down there, and <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> tells her about the histories of some of the ancestors entombed there. They are then surprised by <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade>, <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>'s direwolf, who leaps out at them from the empty future tomb of <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> calls <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade> off, then reveals to <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> that he had the same dream. Making their way out, <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> is still trying to tell <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> that it could be a coincidence, but outside they see <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade>, who holds a letter and looks at them with such sadness that it is obviously the news of <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s death.

 In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> 
    Catelyn comforts her son, promising to avenge <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s death  <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Robb's camp, Catelyn stoically walks through the encampment and receives the condolences and respect of the northern bannermen, who bow to her as she passes. She makes her way into the woods around the camp.  Once she is out of everyone's sight, she breaks down, practically hyperventilating with grief. Hearing something from deeper in the woods, she finds Robb hacking his sword at a tree in anger and grief. <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> Catelyn calls to him and tells him he is ruining his sword. Robb drops the sword and falls into her arms, vowing to kill the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> who murdered his father. Catelyn comforts him and promises him revenge, but only after they rescue Sansa and Arya first.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Robb's camp, Robb and his bannermen debate what to do in the war against King Joffrey. They debate whether to align with <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> or <entidade:Renly Baratheon><entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>, but there is no agreement as <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> has greater forces, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is elder and next in line of succession (if Cersei's children are discounted). <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon <entidade:Umbers>Umber</entidade>><entidade:Umbers>Umber</entidade></entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon <entidade:Umbers>Umber</entidade>><entidade:Umbers>Umber</entidade></entidade></entidade> becomes irritated and questions why the northerners should be told what to do by rulers in the south at all, reminding them that the North was once independent of the other Kingdoms before the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> threatened them with their dragons. With the dragons gone, <entidade:Jon <entidade:Umbers>Umber</entidade>><entidade:Umbers>Umber</entidade></entidade> declares there is only one king worthy of his respect and allegiance and bows before Robb, calling out, "The King in the North!" The other northern bannermen take up the cry and bow before the new King in the North, swearing fealty to Robb.
Catelyn visits the captive <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> who taunts her about <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade>'s death and offers to serve her as a lover. She hits him in the head with a rock. Jaime says that if she keeps hitting him, she can kill him and that he doesn't fear death, though Jaime probably realizes that the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> won't kill him as long as his sister holds Sansa and Arya hostage. Catelyn tells him he has violated the laws of man and gods, and he asks where <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade>'s gods were when his head was cut off (he questions the existence of all gods, the <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> and the <entidade:New>New</entidade>). She says injustice in the world is because of men like him. Jaime responds, "There are no men like me, only me". He admits to pushing <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> from the tower, but doesn't reveal why.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the Lannister camp, Lord <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is holding a strategy meeting with his generals, and is furious that Jaime has been captured by the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>. Both <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> have claimed the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, meaning the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> are now faced with fighting a two-front war against the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> to the north and the <entidade:Baratheons>Baratheons</entidade> to the south. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>'s commanders are uncertain what to do, arguing about whether to strike while they still can, fall back and raise reinforcement armies, or sue for peace. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> points out that any chance of negotiating with <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade> died when his father <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> was executed. The Lannister army is now exposed, so <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> decides to retreat to <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, the great castle on the northern shores of Gods <entidade:Eye>Eye</entidade>, and use it as a base of operations. Reluctantly impressed by <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s astute judgment of the situation, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> orders his son to go to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and serve as Acting <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King in <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>'s stead. He is to bring Cersei and Joffrey to heel and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> also tells him to deal with Baelish, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, and <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> if he gets so much as a hint of treachery from any of them. He also orders <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to leave his whore behind. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> on in his tent, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> complains about his father to <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, then decides to defy <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> and take <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> to court anyway.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> learns of his father's death. He saddles a horse and prepares to leave to join Robb's army, ignoring Samwell's pleas to stay and fulfill his oaths. Jon leaves <entidade:Battle <entidade:Castle Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:Castle Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>, but is pursued. One of his pursuers hits a tree branch and is unhorsed, and Jon realizes it was Sam. He turns back to help him. The other riders are <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> and <entidade:Pypar>Pypar</entidade>. He tells them to go back or they will get in trouble too, but they say they can't go back without him. They surround him and recite their oath to the Night's Watch, and Jon realizes they are right: leaving would make him a deserter and oathbreaker, something his father would never countenance if he were alive, and Jon doesn't even know if Robb would accept his help or turn him over to the authorities. He agrees to return to the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> with them.
Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jeor Mormont><entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> Mormont</entidade> decides to overlook Jon's brief desertion, saying many have fled the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, only to think better of it and return. If they executed everyone who did that, they'd have no men left. Mormont tells Jon that the war between the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> and <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> is less important than what they face now, a renewed threat from the wildlings, <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, and wights. Mormont means to lead the Night's Watch in force into the <entidade:Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade>>Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade></entidade> to learn more of their foe, to prepare to battle against them, and to find the missing <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen Stark</entidade>. Jon agrees to commit himself fully to the Night's Watch and all that lies ahead.

 Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> 
    Daenerys regains consciousness.  In the wastelands beyond <entidade:Lhazareen>Lhazar</entidade>, Daenerys wakes up to terrible news from Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade>. Her son, <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>, is dead. He was born dead and deformed, covered with scales. The majority of the khalasar has also moved on, leaving them behind. However, <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> lives. Daenerys insists on seeing her husband, and finds him a catatonic vegetable. Daenerys demands to know why, and <entidade:Mirri Maz <entidade:Mirri Maz Duur>Duur</entidade>>Mirri Maz <entidade:Mirri Maz Duur>Duur</entidade></entidade> explains that when Daenerys "saved" her, she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the Dothraki. They had sacked her village, looted all they owned, and those not killed were enslaved. She has now gotten her revenge, not only on <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>, but on Daenerys' child <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>; now her "<entidade:Stallion Who Mounts>Stallion Who Mounts</entidade> the <entidade:World>World</entidade>" can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents. <entidade:Mirri Maz Duur>Duur</entidade> agrees that Daenerys saved her life, but she says to ask <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> what life is worth when all else is gone.
It is night, and Daenerys is in their tent tending to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>. She baths him, talks to him, even tries to seduce him, but nothing she does reaches him. She realizes he is no longer there, and seeing him in his vegetative state breaks her heart. Crying, Daenerys kisses him goodbye, then smothers him with a pillow.
Daenerys and her small retinue prepare a funeral pyre for <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>. She makes a speech to the few who are left saying that if they wish to go they may, but if they stay with her she will lead them into a glorious future. She frees those of them who are slaves and asks that they stay as equals. The maegi smirks as some people begin walking away. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Daenerys' command, <entidade:Rakharo>Rakharo</entidade> places the dragon eggs on the pyre, and <entidade:Mirri Maz <entidade:Mirri Maz Duur>Duur</entidade>>Mirri Maz <entidade:Mirri Maz Duur>Duur</entidade></entidade> is tied to a stake next to the pyre as well. She tells Daenerys that she will not scream while she is burned alive. Daenerys replies that she only wants the maegi's life. Ser Jorah believes that Daenerys intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider, as they can sell the eggs and travel far away. Ignoring Jorah's pleas, she kisses his cheek, and sets the pyre alight. <entidade:Mirri Maz <entidade:Mirri Maz Duur>Duur</entidade>>Mirri Maz <entidade:Mirri Maz Duur>Duur</entidade></entidade> does indeed scream as she burns, and Daenerys calmly walks into the flames. She stands below the pyre as flames appear to consume her.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> dawn, the fire dies down. Jorah and the rest of the khalasar awake to find Daenerys sitting among the still smoldering embers, with three newly-hatched baby dragons crawling over her. Her clothes have burnt away and her body is covered in ash, but she is completely unharmed. One dragon nuzzles in her arm, another climbs her leg, and the third pulls itself up to sit on her shoulder. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the sight of the mythical animals born anew, an amazed Jorah and the few remaining Dothraki kneel and swear their allegiance to the <entidade:Mother>Mother</entidade> of Dragons. After she slowly stands up from the ashes, the black hatchling on her shoulder rises, spreads its wings and screams, announcing the return of dragons to the world.
