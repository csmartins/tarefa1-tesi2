<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> stops at <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> on his way back to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and gets a frosty reception from <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, despite an act of kindness for <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> joins the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>, and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> becomes his friend and protector. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> arrives at Vaes <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothrak</entidade> and finally stands up to <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade>. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> continues to investigate the death of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>. <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> hosts a grand tourney for Eddard's investiture as <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>, to Ned's discomfort. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik Cassel</entidade> stop at the <entidade:Crossroads Inn>Crossroads Inn</entidade>.


 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> speaks with <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>.  <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> has a nightmare in which he sees a three-eyed raven, sitting on one of the stone direwolves outside the doorway to the <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> crypts. He wakes up to find his direwolf <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> by his side. Theon <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> summons <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>, the castle's dim-witted stableboy, who can only say the word "Hodor", to help carry <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> down to the great hall, where <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> is hosting a meeting with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade>, both traveling down from the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> together. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>, silently letting <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> know he is not invited to stay at <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>.
When <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> arrives, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> sympathizes with <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> for being a cripple, which annoys <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>, as does asking him if he likes to ride, but <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> simply says it is the truth, no less so for being a hard truth. He gives the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> the design of a saddle which will allow <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> to ride even in his current state. He does it to repay Bran's half-brother's friendship and because he has a weakness for, "Cripples, bastards and broken things." Due to this kindness, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> says he can stay, but <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> says he would prefer the brothel in town. While preparing to leave the castle, Theon comes to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and rather condescendingly sends him off, recommending the prostitute <entidade:Roslin Frey>Ros</entidade> at the brothel. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> asks Theon why <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> was not present to receive him and concludes that <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> is not in <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>. He also taunts Theon about how the son of the ferocious <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> has been reduced to playing lackey in <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> to his captors, which infuriates Theon and gives him a coin, assuming that he has not already had sex with <entidade:Roslin Frey>Ros</entidade>.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
    <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> joins the new recruits at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>.  
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, a new recruit for the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> has arrived: <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade>, the son of the famous <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Randyll Tarly>Randyll Tarly</entidade>. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell</entidade> is fat, soft and pampered, and in his first practice fight does dismally. Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> has no time for his weakness. He directs the other recruits to attack 'Ser Piggy', but <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> finds this cruel and unfair, and takes pity on <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> and fends off the attackers. <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> tries to turn it into a game, ordering three trainees take on Sam's protector (taunting <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that he has found a new <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> love), but <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> nevertheless fends them all off. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell</entidade> is naive and self-deprecating, claiming to be a coward and craven, to Jon's astonishment. <entidade:North Edit>No</entidade> one admits to being a coward, and <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> says that they shouldn't even be seen talking to him.
<entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> joins <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> on the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> for sentry duty, even though he says his eyesight is weak, he is afraid of heights, and can't take the cold. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> asks why he joined the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> as he is afraid of everything. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> tells him that on his eighteenth nameday his father offered him a choice. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> was a man and his heir, but he was not skilled at combat, he was unworthy of his name and birthright. Samwall's father forced him to join the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>, and told him that if he refused, he would arrange a "hunting trip" with his son in the woods, and implied that <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> would be killed in a way that looked accidental. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is shocked that a true born son of high birth should be treated worse than he himself had been as a bastard. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> knows that the next day he will be made to fight again and expects it to be bad.

    <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> yields to <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell</entidade>.  <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> orders the recruits to go easy on <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade>, but <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> refuses, saying that if Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> orders him to fight 'Lady Piggy', he will slice himself off a side of bacon. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> response to Rast's comments, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> to intimidate <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> into playing along. The next day, no one will fight <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade>. After <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> takes a very weak blow from <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> and yields, Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> scolds <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> for his rebellious actions. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, when <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> are cleaning the dining hall, they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> tells <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that he has not had success with girls, while <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> reveals he'd rather not risk siring a child that will have the life of a bastard like himself. A furious <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> comes in and tells <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that this charity won't help <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> harden up to survive the winter that is coming. He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> that ended in cannibalism.
Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
Khal Drogo's khalasar arrives at Vaes <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothrak</entidade>, the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> city. There are no city walls, but there is a large gateway arch made of two statues of rearing horses. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> is annoyed that <entidade:Drogon>Drogo</entidade> has been taking 'his' army in the wrong direction. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, he bathes with <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade> and tells her about how he was raised with stories about the <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> dragons and his own destiny. He recites the names of several dragons, and tells her about the skulls of dragons that once decorated the throne room at King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, but she starts to annoy him with talk of dragons, reminding him that they are dead. He tells her to finish pleasuring him in silence.
<entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> is enraged when <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> sends <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade> with an invite for him to dine with her, as he interprets this as his sister commanding him to come. He drags <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade> into Daenerys' tent, and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him. He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade>, having refused to dress like a <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>, whom he regards as savage pordh. He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in battle, which further infuriates him. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> his anger, <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her, calling her nothing but a "horselord's slut", and warning her that she's "awoken the Dragon", but this time she fights back, hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt. She tells a thunderstruck <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> that she is the Khal's wife, and is carrying his child (and by implication, <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> is nothing to the Dothraki), and warns that if he raises a hand against her again, he will lose his hands. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> confides in <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> her realization that <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> will never become <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> of <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. He is so weak and ineffectual that he couldn't command an army even if <entidade:Drogon>Drogo</entidade> gave him one, to which <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> agrees.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> visits the <entidade:Great Hall>Great Hall</entidade>, where the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> sits. She and <entidade:Septa Mordane>Septa Mordane</entidade> discuss the expectation that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> will have to provide <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> with an heir. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> thinks the realm will hate her if she only has daughters, along with her belief <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is still angry over the incident by the river and her anger at her father over Lady's death.

    The small council meets.  During a meeting of the small council, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> learns that the forthcoming tournament to celebrate his appointment is seeing the city swell with visitors, and has already resulted in a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race. He tells <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> that money will have to be found to strengthen the city guards, as well as giving twenty of his own men to <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos</entidade> Slynt's command, until the tournament is over. After the meeting <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> talks to Grand <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> about <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> Arryn's last few weeks. <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> said he did all he could to save <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>, but the illness was sudden and severe. He recalls that shortly before his sudden illness, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Arryn</entidade> had borrowed a truly boring book about the lineages of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, and his last words were, "The seed is strong."
Taking the book with him, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> comes across <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> in the hall standing on one leg as part of her training with <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks whether <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> would be able to live in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> with them now that he's awoken, but <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> states that he would have to regain his strength first. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> then comments that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> had always wanted to be a knight in the King's <entidade:Guard>Guard</entidade>, but will no longer be able to due to his paralysis. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> confirms this to be the case, but states that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> will be able to do many other things such as become lord of a holdfast, sit on the King's council, or raise castles. When <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks if she would be able to become any of those, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> instead tells her that she will marry a highborn lord and have lords and princes for sons. However, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is not pleased with this response, telling her father, "that's not me." She goes back to balancing on one leg as <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> looks on.

    <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr</entidade> talks with <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>.  <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> meets with <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> and suggests that he keep his investigation into <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> Arryn's death lower in profile. He also gives <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> some interesting intelligence: <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> Arryn's former squire has been knighted and will fight in the forthcoming Hand's tourney. He also advises him to investigate an armorer located in the city. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> decides that <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> may be more trustworthy than he first thought, but <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> discourages him from thinking that way. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> sends <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory Cassel</entidade> to question <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> Arryn's former squire, Ser <entidade:Hugh>Hugh</entidade> of the <entidade:Vale Arryn>Vale</entidade>. However, deducing that <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> was not a knight, Ser <entidade:Hugh>Hugh</entidade> simply rebuffs him and refuses to speak with him due to his much lower rank. Eddard's investigation leads him to a smithy in the city, where he meets master smith <entidade:Tobho Mott>Tobho Mott</entidade> and his apprentice <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>, whose work <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was also apparently interested in. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> realizes that <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> is one of <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> Robert's bastard sons, but can't work out why <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> would be interested in this: <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> has many bastard children and shows little interest in any of them.
Later, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> sends <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> with a message for <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade>, but upon arriving at his quarters, the sounds of many women can he heard coming from Robert's chamber. Ser <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside, flaunting his dishonorable treatment of Jaime's sister in his face. He and <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> reminisce about the <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> Rebellion, in which they both fought for <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> Robert's forces to put down an attempt by <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> (Theon's father) to secede the <entidade:Iron Islands>Iron Islands</entidade> from the rest of the realm. <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> tries to leave Eddard's message with <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, but is rebuffed, as <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> angrily states that he does not serve <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>.     <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and <entidade:Septa Mordane>Septa Mordane</entidade> at the tournament.  The tournament begins and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> watches from the stands. Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Clegane</entidade>, the elder brother of <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade>, the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade>, takes the field. His first joust is with Ser <entidade:Hugh>Hugh</entidade>. However, the friendly joust turns nasty and <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> kills Ser <entidade:Hugh>Hugh</entidade> "by accident", with a splinter of the lance impaling his neck. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> sits next to <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, and remarks that she and <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> have had a lover's quarrel (as <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is still giving her the cold shoulder). <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> then tells <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> that <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade>, the "Mountain That Rides", has a dark reputation: he pushed his little brother Sandor's face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young, burning him severely. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> recommends that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> not spread that story around.
<entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> visits <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> at his chambers, remarking at how the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> is not at his own tournament. Though <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the <entidade:Kingsroad>Kingsroad</entidade> behind them, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> then wonders aloud to <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> what his true purpose is for being at King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, as she knows how little <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> enjoy being in the capital. When <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> tells her he is to faithfully serve their <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> remarks that as his brother <entidade:Brandon>Brandon</entidade> was born to lead, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> was born to follow.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Crossroads Inn>Crossroads Inn</entidade>, <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik Cassel</entidade>, on their way home to <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, are enjoying the hospitality of the innkeeper and, more reluctantly, the attempts by the troubadour <entidade:Marillion>Marillion</entidade> to ingratiate himself with them. (He is doing a poor job: when he asks if they would like a song, he is refused.) They are surprised when <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> arrive. When told there aren't any rooms, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him. Quickly <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> gains the favor of a sellsword, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, who agrees to give his room to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. <entidade:Marillion>Marillion</entidade> draws the attention of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to Catelyn's table, by offering to serenade him while he eats, singing of his father's military victories. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> says nothing would more likely ruin his appetite, but as he is turning away, he recognizes <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> and is surprised at this meeting by chance. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> return <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> tells the stunned inn that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> tried to murder her son <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> twice and that she asks their help in bringing him to the king's justice. The inn is located in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, in the territory controlled by her father, so the knights present owe him their fealty. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> finds himself surrounded by half a dozen men with swords, and in Catelyn's custody.
