In <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>, <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade>' frustrations at the constant delays before he can receive his crown boil over. In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, while <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> goes on a hunt, Eddard issues a decree that could splinter the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> and makes a startling discovery about the heirs to the throne. In the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> wagers everything on the greed of the sellsword <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>.


In the <entidade:Crownlands>Crownlands</entidade>
<entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> Stark wakes up after a long period of unconsciousness, due to the injuries inflicted on him by <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>'s men. He finds both <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> Baratheon and <entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade> waiting. 

    King <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> hunting party.  
Cersei is furious with Eddard's acts in having her brother <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> arrested and attacking Jaime in the street. She wants Robert to take action against him, but Robert refuses to condemn him without hearing Eddard's side, and tells her to be silent. When Cersei protests further, and calls Robert a woman, he hits her. She says that she will wear the bruise with honor. He tells her to be silent, or he will honor her again, and Cersei leaves in anger. Afterwards, Robert restores Eddard to his position as King's <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>, and tells him not to quit again, or he will give the position to <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>. He tells <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> to end the animosity between <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade> and <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade>, as strife between these two powerful houses could lead them into war. He is leaving on a hunt and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> has another "dancing" lesson with <entidade:<entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade>, but isn't in the mood due to <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade>'s death. <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> tells her that she may need to fight at any time, not just when she's in the mood. He wisely reminds her that being prepared to fight is more important in times of sadness than in peaceful times of happiness.
<entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> is out hunting, accompanied by his brother Renly, <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> Selmy and <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade>. Robert, being supplied with wine by Lancel, becomes drunk and nostalgic, longing for the days of young knights trying to make a name for themselves and when enemies stood openly in opposition (instead of being hidden schemers). Robert brags about all the women he has bedded, but Renly becomes irate when he begins to question him about his history with women. Renly calls him a fool and remarks that the past had its share of violence that Robert is conveniently ignoring. Renly storms off, leaving <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> to look on concerned, as Lancel keeps up King <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> wine supply.
In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, at a meeting of the small council, a group of refugees come to tell of how their villages have been destroyed. Eddard hears tales of a huge knight ravaging the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. He realizes that it's Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, "The <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade>", who is likely under Lannister orders to punish the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> - which are held by <entidade:House <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade>>House <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade></entidade>, the former House of his wife Catelyn, who now holds <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> captive. Even though <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> told him to make peace with the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> could not bring himself to let this injustice stand. Eddard strips <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade> of his knighthood, land, and titles, and sends Lord <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric Dondarrion</entidade> with a retinue of one hundred knights to arrest and execute him in the king's name. 

    Eddard discovers the secret <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> died for.  
He also orders Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> to send word to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>, demanding Lord <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>'s presence in court to explain his bannerman's actions or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm. '<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>' <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> Baelish, and Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and Eddard's actions against the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, but Eddard wants to see justice done.
<entidade:Prince Joffrey>Prince Joffrey</entidade> comes to apologize to Sansa for the incident on the <entidade:Kingsroad>Kingsroad</entidade>. He calls her his lady love and gives her a necklace. Sansa forgives him, and they seem reconciled. Sansa is unaware that the Queen put Joffrey up to the apology some time ago.
Eddard decides to send his daughters back to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is worried that she must leave <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade>. Sansa protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor, they are talking about breaking her betrothal to Joffrey. <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> says that he will find someone else for her. Sansa refuses—she is going to marry Joffrey and have lots of golden-haired babies. This gives Eddard pause and sends him back to the book that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was looking at before he died. Consulting the book's entry on <entidade:House Baratheon>House Baratheon</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> finds that every time a Baratheon has married, the children have had black hair…right up to Cersei and <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> children, who are all blond.

 In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
    <entidade:Stiv>Stiv</entidade> and <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> accost <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> near <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.  
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has another dream about the three-eyed raven, in which it flies into the castle's crypts. He wakes up to find that Hodor has brought the finished saddle designed by <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>. He goes on a ride with Robb and Theon. They have had word from <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> about Eddard's injury, <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade>'s death and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s capture. Theon thinks that Robb should prepare the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> for war, but Robb is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come, and until then will follow his parents' orders to remain in <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. They discover that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has wandered off on his horse and go looking for him. Robb finds a group of wildlings threatening <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and trying to steal his horse. Robb kills two, but another wildling holds <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> with a knife to the throat. Theon shoots him from behind, angering Robb by endangering <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>. The remaining wildling, a woman named <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade>, yields and begs for her life. Robb agrees to take her as a prisoner.

    Theon tells Ros he will miss her as she leaves for <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>.  
Ros, the prostitute that Theon frequently sees, is departing <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> for <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> on the back of a turnip cart. Theon stops her and unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay. She explains that war is now imminent and the men (and thus her customer base) of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> are destined to leave soon and probably never return; her departure is thus an economically essential decision. He throws her a coin to get her to raise her skirt one last time. As she rides off he says that he will miss her. She agrees that he will.    <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s verbal skills are wasted on <entidade:Septa Mordane>Mord</entidade>.  
 In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> 
At the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> almost rolls out of his sky cell in his sleep, to his consternation. He tries to make a bargain with the gaoler, <entidade:Septa Mordane>Mord</entidade>, to no avail.
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> convinces <entidade:Septa Mordane>Mord</entidade> to carry a message to Lady <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> and, in exchange, he will give <entidade:Septa Mordane>Mord</entidade> the gold he had with him when he was captured. Lysa summons <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit, but all he confesses to is being a liar, a whoremonger, and a player of practical jokes. He maintains his innocence of the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder.

    <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> on trial in the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>.  
However, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> uses the opportunity of his audience in front of Lysa's court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial, and Lysa is shamed into agreeing. Given that Lysa's son is a young boy and wouldn't make a good judge in a formal trial, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> instead demands a trial by combat, which Lysa also reluctantly agrees is his right. Given that neither Lysa nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat, she asks for a volunteer to be her champion, and <entidade:Ser <entidade:Vardis>Vardis</entidade> Egen>Ser <entidade:Vardis>Vardis</entidade> Egen</entidade> agrees. Egen is unwilling to fight <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> however, as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> names his own champion: his brother Jaime, considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm. At this Lysa does object, as Jaime is not present and she does not want to wait. She demands that he pick a champion from those present. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> desperately asks for volunteers, and after a long pause during which it seems that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s cause is lost, the sellsword <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> steps forward and says he will stand for him.    <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> kicks <entidade:Ser <entidade:Vardis>Vardis</entidade> Egen>Ser <entidade:Vardis>Vardis</entidade> Egen</entidade>'s corpse out of the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>.  
<entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> fights defensively, waiting for <entidade:Vardis>Vardis</entidade> to tire, as unlike <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> he is dressed in full armor. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> finally gets his chance; he first wounds and then kills <entidade:Vardis>Vardis</entidade>, sending his body rolling out of the "<entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>" that leads to a thousand-foot drop. Lysa complains that <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> did not fight with honor. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> agrees, but indicates that <entidade:Vardis>Vardis</entidade> did fight with honor. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> has proven his innocence in the eyes of the gods. He retrieves his gold from <entidade:Ser Rodrik>Ser Rodrik</entidade> and gives it to <entidade:Septa Mordane>Mord</entidade>. When Robin asks if he can make the little man fly now, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> says, "This little man is going home." <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> are allowed to depart.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daenerys and one of her dragon eggs.  
In <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> is studying her dragon eggs. Despite Illyrio's claim that they are now only stone, she ponders if they might be hatched by extreme heat, and places an egg on a brazier. Nothing happens, to her disappointment. She is removing the egg from the brazier, when <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> comes in and thinks she will scald herself. <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> takes the egg from her, but Daenerys is completely unharmed, and it is <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> who suffers scalding burns on her own hands.
Daenerys is summoned by the crones who rule the city, the dosh khaleen, the wives of khals slain in battle. She eats a stallion's heart and the crones read the omens. At first it seems <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> won't keep the raw meat down, but, to both her and <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> relief, she is able to compose herself. The crones declare Daenerys and <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> son will be "The <entidade:Stallion>Stallion</entidade> That Mounts The <entidade:World>World</entidade>", a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> history. Daenerys says his name will be <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>, for her brother Rhaegar, slain by the usurper <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade>. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> is not impressed and rather disgusted by it all. He stands with <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> who explains the ritual to him. It is only when the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> are chanting <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>'s name, and Drogo lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room, that <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> realizes they love her. 

    Jorah <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> prevents <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> from stealing <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>'s eggs.  
He storms out of the tent. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> is later discovered in Daenerys' tent by <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, trying to steal <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>'s dragon eggs, but Jorah won't let him. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> tells <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> that to rule one must be feared or loved, and he has never been loved as the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> love <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>. He says he knows that Jorah wants Daenerys, but he doesn't care. He just wants the eggs so he can hire an army, but he can't get past <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> and must leave the eggs. <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> watches him as he leaves.
<entidade:Drunk>Drunk</entidade>, bitter and angry, <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> interrupts a feast for Daenerys and Drogo. He angrily demands his payment in return for giving Daenerys to Drogo. Then he draws his sword, which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city, and threatens <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> and the unborn child, while <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> translates to Drogo. 

    <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> gives <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> a golden crown.  
Drogo responds that he will give <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> a golden crown "that men will tremble to behold", and <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> is pleased until <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> bloodrider <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> breaks his arm, making him drop the sword, and kicks him to the floor. Drogo melts his golden belt in a pot, while <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> begs Daenerys to help him. <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> tells her to look away, but she won't. She watches as <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> "crowns" <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> by pouring molten gold over his head, causing <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> to cry out in pure agony. As Daenerys watches her brother die, she coldly states that, having been killed by fire, <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> was no true dragon.
