In <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>, <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade>' frustrations at the constant delays before he can receive his crown boil over. In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, while King Robert goes on a hunt, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> issues a decree that could splinter the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> and makes a startling discovery about the heirs to the throne. In the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> wagers everything on the greed of the sellsword <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>.


In the Crownlands
Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade> wakes up after a long period of unconsciousness, due to the injuries inflicted on him by <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>'s men. He finds both King <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> and Queen Cersei waiting. 

    King Robert's hunting party.  
Cersei is furious with <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s acts in having her brother <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> arrested and attacking Jaime in the street. She wants Robert to take action against him, but Robert refuses to condemn him without hearing <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s side, and tells her to be silent. When Cersei protests further, and calls Robert a woman, he hits her. She says that she will wear the bruise with honor. He tells her to be silent, or he will honor her again, and Cersei leaves in anger. Afterwards, Robert restores <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> to his position as King's <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>, and tells him not to quit again, or he will give the position to <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>. He tells Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> to end the animosity between <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade> and <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade>, as strife between these two powerful houses could lead them into war. He is leaving on a hunt and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns.
Arya has another "dancing" lesson with <entidade:Syrio Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade>, but isn't in the mood due to <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade>'s death. <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> tells her that she may need to fight at any time, not just when she's in the mood. He wisely reminds her that being prepared to fight is more important in times of sadness than in peaceful times of happiness.
King Robert is out hunting, accompanied by his brother <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>, Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> and <entidade:Lancel Lannister><entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> Lannister</entidade>. Robert, being supplied with wine by <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade>, becomes drunk and nostalgic, longing for the days of young knights trying to make a name for themselves and when enemies stood openly in opposition (instead of being hidden schemers). Robert brags about all the women he has bedded, but <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> becomes irate when he begins to question him about his history with women. <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> calls him a fool and remarks that the past had its share of violence that Robert is conveniently ignoring. <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> storms off, leaving Ser Barristan to look on concerned, as <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> keeps up King Robert's wine supply.
In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, at a meeting of the small council, a group of refugees come to tell of how their villages have been destroyed. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> hears tales of a huge knight ravaging the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. He realizes that it's Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane><entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> Clegane</entidade>, "The <entidade:Mountain That Rides>Mountain</entidade>", who is likely under Lannister orders to punish the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> - which are held by House Tully, the former House of his wife Catelyn, who now holds <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> captive. Even though King Robert told him to make peace with the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> could not bring himself to let this injustice stand. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> strips <entidade:Gregor Clegane><entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> Clegane</entidade> of his knighthood, land, and titles, and sends Lord <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric Dondarrion</entidade> with a retinue of one hundred knights to arrest and execute him in the king's name. 

    <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> discovers the secret <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> died for.  
He also orders Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> to send word to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>, demanding Lord <entidade:Tywin Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>'s presence in court to explain his bannerman's actions or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm. '<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>' <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade>, and Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s actions against the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, but <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> wants to see justice done.
<entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> Joffrey comes to apologize to Sansa for the incident on the <entidade:Kingsroad>Kingsroad</entidade>. He calls her his lady love and gives her a necklace. Sansa forgives him, and they seem reconciled. Sansa is unaware that the Queen put Joffrey up to the apology some time ago.
<entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> decides to send his daughters back to <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>. Arya is worried that she must leave <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade>. Sansa protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor, they are talking about breaking her betrothal to Joffrey. Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> says that he will find someone else for her. Sansa refuses—she is going to marry Joffrey and have lots of golden-haired babies. <entidade:This>This</entidade> gives <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> pause and sends him back to the book that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was looking at before he died. Consulting the book's entry on House Baratheon, Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> finds that every time a Baratheon has married, the children have had black hair…right up to Cersei and Robert's children, who are all blond.

 In the North 
    <entidade:Stiv>Stiv</entidade> and <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> accost <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> near <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>.  
In <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has another dream about the three-eyed raven, in which it flies into the castle's crypts. He wakes up to find that <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> has brought the finished saddle designed by <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. He goes on a ride with Robb and Theon. They have had word from King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> about <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s injury, <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade>'s death and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s capture. Theon thinks that Robb should prepare the North for war, but Robb is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come, and until then will follow his parents' orders to remain in <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>. They discover that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has wandered off on his horse and go looking for him. Robb finds a group of wildlings threatening <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and trying to steal his horse. Robb kills two, but another wildling holds <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> with a knife to the throat. Theon shoots him from behind, angering Robb by endangering <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>. The remaining wildling, a woman named <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade>, yields and begs for her life. Robb agrees to take her as a prisoner.

    Theon tells Ros he will miss her as she leaves for King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>.  
Ros, the prostitute that Theon frequently sees, is departing <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> for King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> on the back of a turnip cart. Theon stops her and unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay. She explains that war is now imminent and the men (and thus her customer base) of <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> are destined to leave soon and probably never return; her departure is thus an economically essential decision. He throws her a coin to get her to raise her skirt one last time. As she rides off he says that he will miss her. She agrees that he will.    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s verbal skills are wasted on Mord.  
 In the Vale 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> almost rolls out of his sky cell in his sleep, to his consternation. He tries to make a bargain with the gaoler, Mord, to no avail.
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> convinces Mord to carry a message to <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> and, in exchange, he will give Mord the gold he had with him when he was captured. Lysa summons <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit, but all he confesses to is being a liar, a whoremonger, and a player of practical jokes. He maintains his innocence of the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder.

    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> on trial in the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>.  
However, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> uses the opportunity of his audience in front of Lysa's court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial, and Lysa is shamed into agreeing. Given that Lysa's son is a young boy and wouldn't make a good judge in a formal trial, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> instead demands a trial by combat, which Lysa also reluctantly agrees is his right. Given that neither Lysa nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat, she asks for a volunteer to be her champion, and Ser <entidade:Vardis Egen>Vardis Egen</entidade> agrees. Egen is unwilling to fight <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> however, as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> names his own champion: his brother Jaime, considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> this Lysa does object, as Jaime is not present and she does not want to wait. She demands that he pick a champion from those present. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> desperately asks for volunteers, and after a long pause during which it seems that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s cause is lost, the sellsword <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> steps forward and says he will stand for him.    <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> kicks Ser <entidade:Vardis Egen>Vardis Egen</entidade>'s corpse out of the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>.  
<entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> fights defensively, waiting for Vardis to tire, as unlike <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> he is dressed in full armor. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> finally gets his chance; he first wounds and then kills Vardis, sending his body rolling out of the "<entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>" that leads to a thousand-foot drop. Lysa complains that <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> did not fight with honor. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> agrees, but indicates that Vardis did fight with honor. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> has proven his innocence in the eyes of the gods. He retrieves his gold from Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik</entidade> and gives it to Mord. When <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> asks if he can make the little man fly now, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> says, "<entidade:This>This</entidade> little man is going home." <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> are allowed to depart.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daenerys and one of her dragon eggs.  
In <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>, Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> is studying her dragon eggs. Despite Illyrio's claim that they are now only stone, she ponders if they might be hatched by extreme heat, and places an egg on a brazier. Nothing happens, to her disappointment. She is removing the egg from the brazier, when <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> comes in and thinks she will scald herself. <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> takes the egg from her, but Daenerys is completely unharmed, and it is <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> who suffers scalding burns on her own hands.
Daenerys is summoned by the crones who rule the city, the dosh khaleen, the wives of khals slain in battle. She eats a stallion's heart and the crones read the omens. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> first it seems <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> won't keep the raw meat down, but, to both her and <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>'s relief, she is able to compose herself. The crones declare Daenerys and <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>'s son will be "The Stallion That Mounts The <entidade:World>World</entidade>", a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in Dothraki history. Daenerys says his name will be <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>, for her brother Rhaegar, slain by the usurper <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade>. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> is not impressed and rather disgusted by it all. He stands with Ser Jorah who explains the ritual to him. It is only when the Dothraki are chanting <entidade:Rhaego>Rhaego</entidade>'s name, and <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room, that <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> realizes they love her. 

    <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> prevents <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> from stealing <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>'s eggs.  
He storms out of the tent. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> is later discovered in Daenerys' tent by Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade>, trying to steal <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>'s dragon eggs, but Jorah won't let him. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> tells Ser Jorah that to rule one must be feared or loved, and he has never been loved as the Dothraki love <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>. He says he knows that Jorah wants Daenerys, but he doesn't care. He just wants the eggs so he can hire an army, but he can't get past Ser Jorah and must leave the eggs. Mormont watches him as he leaves.
Drunk, bitter and angry, <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> interrupts a feast for Daenerys and <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>. He angrily demands his payment in return for giving Daenerys to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>. Then he draws his sword, which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city, and threatens <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> and the unborn child, while <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> translates to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>. 

    <entidade:Khal <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>>Khal <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade></entidade> gives <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> a golden crown.  
<entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> responds that he will give <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> a golden crown "that men will tremble to behold", and <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> is pleased until <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>'s bloodrider <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> breaks his arm, making him drop the sword, and kicks him to the floor. <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> melts his golden belt in a pot, while <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> begs Daenerys to help him. Ser Jorah tells her to look away, but she won't. She watches as <entidade:Khal <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>>Khal <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade></entidade> "crowns" <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> by pouring molten gold over his head, causing <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> to cry out in pure agony. As Daenerys watches her brother die, she coldly states that, having been killed by fire, <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> was no true dragon.
