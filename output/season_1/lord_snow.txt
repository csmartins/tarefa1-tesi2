<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> attempts to find his footing at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> amidst hostility and suspicion from his fellow members of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> and his daughters arrive at <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. Catelyn renews an old friendship with a member of the court, while Daenerys and <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> journey onwards to the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> capital of <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>.


In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
    The Stark party arrives in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>.  
The royal party reaches <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. Almost immediately, <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> Stark is asked to attend a meeting of the king's small council and to change his clothes, but he refuses to the latter. Before that he encounters <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> in the throne room. Jaime is still unhappy that Eddard judged him dishonorable for killing the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade>, the murderer of Eddard's father and brother. Jaime is unrepentant about it. Eddard meets the council members: <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade></entidade> "<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>" Baelish, the king's <entidade:Master of Coin>Master of Coin</entidade> and a friend of Eddard's wife from childhood; Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade>, the king's adviser in all matters scientific and academic; Lord <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly Baratheon</entidade>, the youngest of the king's two brothers and <entidade:Master of Laws>Master of Laws</entidade>; and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>, a eunuch and the <entidade:Master of Whisperers>Master of Whisperers</entidade> (the head of the king's intelligence network).
<entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> tells Eddard that the council members heard about his "troubles on the <entidade:Kingsroad>Kingsroad</entidade>" and that they pray for Joffrey's recovery. Eddard grimly responds "It's a shame no one prayed for the butcher's boy", which visibly upsets <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>.
Eddard is stunned to learn that the crown is six million <entidade:Gold <entidade:Gold Dragons>Dragons</entidade>>Gold <entidade:Gold Dragons>Dragons</entidade></entidade> in debt, half of which is to Lord <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>. To make matters worse, <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> has just ordered a lavish tournament to celebrate Eddard's appointment. He resolves to advise Robert to cancel the tournament, but the council is doubtful that the King will listen.

    Cersei and her son Joffrey.  
<entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade> talks to Joffrey about the incident on the river. She tells him that when he is king, the truth will be whatever he decides it will be. Joffrey thinks there will be trouble with the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>, and promises that when he is king, he will double their taxes, force them to contribute to a standing army and, should they object, crush them and install someone loyal, such as his great-uncle Kevan, as <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. Cersei points out that the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders, and a king needs to be more clever. She also advises him to be kind to his betrothed <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> to avoid stirring up trouble for later, and concludes that "Anyone who isn't us is an enemy."
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and Sansa are still at odds over the incident with Joffrey and her direwolf. Eddard explains that Sansa was put in a difficult position by the king and queen, and while she shouldn't have lied, winning the long-term approval of Joffrey, her future husband, was important. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is unhappy with the situation, but Eddard mollifies her by allowing her to practice with her sword, <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade>.

    Catelyn and Rodrik arrive in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>.  <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> and <entidade:Ser Rodrik>Ser Rodrik</entidade> arrive at <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> and attempt to sneak into the city, but are spotted by one of <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s men. They are taken to meet <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> at a brothel he owns, where <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade></entidade> is also waiting: one of his 'little birds' told him they were coming. Catelyn is angered by the way they've been treated, but asks <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> for aid in finding the people who tried to have <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> killed. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> is able to answer this quickly: the elaborate dagger wielded by the assassin used to be his, but he lost it in a gamble with <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade>.
    Eddard threatens <entidade:Lord Baelish>Lord Baelish</entidade>.  
<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> fetches Eddard to meet his wife, but Eddard suspects a trick and pushes <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> up against a wall outside the brothel wanting to know what his game is. Catelyn then appears, and Eddard is pacified. After hearing her news, he vows to find the truth and expose the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> to Robert. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> agrees to be his ally in this, for the affection he once bore Catelyn as a youngster.
Ravens arrive at <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> with news of <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s recovery. Cersei fears he will expose their secret, but Jaime comforts her.

    Jaime comforts Cersei.  
Elsewhere, Robert swaps old war stories with <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> Selmy, a distinguished and famous knight and the commander of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>. Summoning <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Robert jokingly>Robert jokingly</entidade> questions him about <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys Targaryen</entidade>'s death, wondering if the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade> died begging for mercy, but Jaime rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he'd been saying since the siege of <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> began: "Burn them all".
Eddard has contracted a swordmaster, <entidade:<entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade>, the former <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> <entidade:Sword>Sword</entidade> of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, to teach <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> how to use her sword properly. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is thrilled, and 'the dance' begins. As Eddard watches them practice, his pleasure at seeing <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> happy sours when he realizes that a conflict between the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> and <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> may be inevitable; his daughter may well be training herself for war.

 In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
    <entidade:Old Nan>Old Nan</entidade> tells <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> of winter and the <entidade:Long <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>>Long <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade></entidade>.  
At <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has awoken but has no memory of his accident. His injuries have left him bedridden and unlikely to walk again. <entidade:Old Nan>Old Nan</entidade>, the oldest servant in the castle, tells <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> stories to pass the time, but he doesn't want her usual heroic stories about the likes of <entidade:Ser Duncan>Ser Duncan</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Tall</entidade>. She instead speaks of the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers and the coming of a vast winter that will blanket the world. When Robb pays a visit, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> asks his brother if it is true that his legs are crushed and that he will never walk again. Robb reluctantly says this is so. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> remarks that he would rather be dead.

 At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
At <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, the primary redoubt of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> in the shadow of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> shows his worth to the trainer, <entidade:Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade>>Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade></entidade> Thorne, by besting several fellow members of the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> in the practice yard. Thorne is disgusted at the poor performance of the others but has no praise for Jon either, dubbing him Lord <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade> and describing him as "the least useless person here". Watching over the new recruits with <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> Jeor <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> notes Thorne's stern and unusual ways, but Jeor doesn't care as he only requires Thorne to turn the "thieves and runaways" into men of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. Later on, several of the other recruits gang up on Jon, but the situation is defused by <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> points out to Jon that none of the other recruits had the benefit of a skilled master-at-arms to train them, and that Jon is alienating them through his standoffish attitude and superior combat skills.

    Benjen talks with Jon on the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>.  
<entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen Stark</entidade> meets Jon atop the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and tells him he is going on a ranging in the <entidade:Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade>>Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade></entidade>. He refuses to take Jon with him, telling him he isn't ready, and that here rank and nobility mean nothing: every man must earn everything he gets. Before departing, Benjen stops by the eating area to farewell <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade>, a fellow <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s Watchman who scouts for new recruits in the capital. Benjen also scolds <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> for his naivety regarding what is north of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and states that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> has no authority to say what is or isn't beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> as he hasn't been out there himself.
Later, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> discusses north of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> with Jeor <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> and his chief adviser, the ancient and blind <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade>. Jeor asks for <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to intercede at court and get the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> more men as they are dangerously undermanned. Aemon warns that the Stark words are right: a terrible winter is coming and more dangerous things than just wildlings might come with it; after all, one of their number swore that the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers had returned ... right up to the moment <entidade:<entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade> cut his head off. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> admits his skepticism that supernatural creatures might exist, but he agrees to bring word to his queen.
Before departing for <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> fulfils an old ambition by climbing to the top of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and urinating off the edge of it. He and Jon share a moment of fellowship before <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> departs for the capital in the company of <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade>.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daenerys rides with the khalasar.  
Daenerys commands the khalasar to halt on a whim, exercising her growing authority and power. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> does not take well to being commanded and threatens his sister. He is strangled by <entidade:Rakharo>Rakharo</entidade>, a <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> warrior wielding a whip. Daenerys calms the situation and <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> is forced to walk, a sign of shame amongst the horse-riding <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>. Later, <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> reveals to Daenerys that Daenerys is pregnant. Daenerys relays the news to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> and tells him she thinks it will be a boy as they lie naked in each other's arms. <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> and <entidade:Rakharo>Rakharo</entidade> compare the <entidade:Westerosi>Westerosi</entidade> and <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> ways of battle; the heavily-armored but slow knights versus the lightly-armored but fast-moving horse-warriors. Jorah has heard of <entidade:Rakharo>Rakharo</entidade>'s father, a great warrior, but admits that he disgraced his own father, a man of great honor. When he learns that Daenerys is pregnant, he announces he must split off from the column to ride to the <entidade:Free City of Qohor>Free City of Qohor</entidade>, but will rejoin them before they reach <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>.
