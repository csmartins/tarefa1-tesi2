Plot
<entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> Baratheon majestically arrives in <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, the home of his old and trusted friend, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade>, <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, with an important offer.
On the eastern continent, the exiled Princess <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> marries <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade>, a warlord of the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> with tens of thousands of warriors at his command. Her brother, <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade>, callously plans to win <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> allegiance with the marriage, so that he may return home to <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> and reclaim the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>, which was seized by force from his father by Robert.
In the frozen lands, beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the wildlings are on the move, to the alarm of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. But even farther north, something colder and darker is beginning to stir.

Summary
<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
Three rangers of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>: <entidade:Ser Waymar>Ser Waymar</entidade> Royce, Will, and <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade> depart from the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> to investigate reports of wildlings in the <entidade:Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade>>Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade></entidade> which lies to the north, <entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. Will, the best scout in the group, discovers a number of wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground.

    <entidade:Wight>Wight</entidade> of wildling girl.  He also finds a dead wildling girl pinned to a tree. He reports back to the others. <entidade:Ser Waymar>Ser Waymar</entidade> overrides the older <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade>'s advice that they return to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> to report the situation to their superiors and instead insists on seeing the corpses for himself, to determine what killed them. When they reach the site, the bodies have disappeared. Will scouts around for clues, but <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade> finds a bloody piece of clothing buried under the snow. Further investigations are curtailed when a tall, humanoid figure with glowing blue eyes, a <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker, arrives and kills <entidade:Ser Waymar>Ser Waymar</entidade> with ease. <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade> attempts to escape but is caught and killed. Will, in extreme horror, sees the dead wildling girl from earlier now walking with blue eyes, and also witnesses <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade>'s death, with the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker tossing his severed head at Will's feet.
In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
    <entidade:<entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade> draws his sword.  
Some time later, Will has fled south of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> in terror, rather than return to warn <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> of the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker threat. He is apprehended by outriders loyal to <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade>, the wardens of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, and is taken to <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> Stark. <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade>, in the courtyard watching his son, <entidade:<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> at archery training, decrees that as a deserter from the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, Will is an oathbreaker and must die. Will accepts his fate, but tells Eddard about the Walkers first and asks that word be sent back to his mother. Eddard carries out the execution himself, using the ancestral Valyrian blade of their house, <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade>. Two of Eddard's trueborn sons, 17-year-old Robb and 10-year-old <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>, accompany him to the execution along with his bastard son <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>, his ward, <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>, the master-at-arms <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik Cassel</entidade> and his leading guard <entidade:<entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel><entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel</entidade>. <entidade:Young <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>>Young <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade></entidade> witnesses an execution for the first time without flinching, earning praise from Jon. Eddard explains to <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> that the reason he was made to execute Will was because the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. When <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> asks his father about Will's talk of <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers, Eddard dismisses it as a madman's ramblings, insisting that the Walkers have been gone for centuries. The party sets out to return to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.

    The <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> come across the Direwolves.  
On the way back to the castle, the party finds a stag dead in the road, partially disemboweled. Looking for what killed it, they find a dead female direwolf, killed with a stag antler piece broken off in her throat. The female died after giving birth, and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth. Theon advocates killing the pups, but <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> convinces his father that this is an omen: the direwolf is the symbol of <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade>, and Eddard has five trueborn children. With <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> looking on beseechingly, Eddard agrees that his children should have the pups, but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants. Just as the party leaves, Jon finds a sixth pup, an albino runt of the litter. Theon mockingly points out that this one belongs to Jon.
In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, the capital city of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, the bells ring out to commemorate the death of Lord <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>, the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King. As the <entidade:Silent Sisters>Silent Sisters</entidade> prepare his body for burial, <entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade> Lannister looks on. She is worried that Jon discovered something he shouldn't have, and may have told someone. She confesses her fears to her twin brother, Ser <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, but he tells her not to worry, since if the King knew the truth they'd be dead already. She tells him he should be the new <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King, but he doesn't want the job. He considers it too much work. Cersei accuses him of taking nothing seriously.
A raven bears news of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>'s death to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, where <entidade:Lady Catelyn>Lady Catelyn</entidade> Stark informs Eddard. He is particularly stricken because Arryn served as a father-figure to him, when he was fostered at the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>. She also tells him that <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> Baratheon and much of the royal court rides for <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Eddard realizes that <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> means to name him as the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> to replace <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>. He ponders refusing, feeling his place is at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.
Over the next few weeks the Stark children grow used to their rapidly-growing direwolves: Robb names his <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade>, Sansa calls hers Lady, and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> names hers Nymeria after a great warrior-queen. Jon names his <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade>, for his white color and uncanny silence. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> calls his <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> and six-year-old <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> names his wolf <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade>. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s mother catches him climbing on the rooftops of the castle, just as the royal party comes into view. He promises to stop, but his mother knows he is lying. <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> prepares for guests. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> wants to make sure that <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, a great reader, has enough candles, and the young men of the house get groomed, as they gossip about the queen, a reportedly great beauty.

    <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> gathers to greet the royal party.  
All of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> gathers in the courtyard as the royal party approaches. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is late and annoys Sansa by not being silent and respectful when they arrive. <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> rides in with his knights, while <entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade> is in a large wheelhouse. <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> presents his household to <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade>. Eddard and <entidade:Robert greet>Robert greet</entidade> each other warmly, and then Robert demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to Eddard's deceased sister, <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade>, much to <entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade>'s impatience. After Robert and Eddard depart, Cersei sends Jaime to find their younger brother <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, who is a dwarf. "The <entidade:Imp>Imp</entidade>" has found his way to the brothel in the town outside <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, where he enjoys the attentions of a prostitute named Ros. Jaime tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, a man of limited height but with immense appetites, that he will be needed at the feast that night. Jaime has hired three more prostitutes for <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, to hurry things along.

    <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade>'s statue in the crypts of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.  
In the crypts Robert offers up his prayers at the tomb of <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade> Stark, Eddard's younger sister, whom Robert was betrothed to before she was kidnapped by Prince <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar Targaryen</entidade> and died shortly after being rescued. He tells Eddard that in his dreams he kills Rhaegar every night anew. Eddard reminds him that <entidade:House Targaryen>House Targaryen</entidade> was destroyed, but Robert replies: "not all of them."
Robert formally offers Eddard the role of <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>, and Eddard asks for time to consider. Robert agrees, but offers a sweetener: the hand of his son, Joffrey, in marriage to Eddard's daughter, Sansa. A great feast is held and Cersei and Catelyn exchange cordial words. Cersei seems more impressed by Sansa, thinking that she will be a great hit at court. <entidade:Outside>Outside</entidade> the feast, <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> works at his sword practice, angry that Catelyn thought it would be inappropriate that a bastard should attend. His uncle <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen Stark</entidade>, <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> Ranger of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, arrives to join the feast, and Jon asks him to take him back to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> with him. Benjen agrees to consider it. <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> then arrives and talks to Jon, suggesting that he is too pricklish and quick to take offense when his illegitimacy is pointed out. He should take the insult and wear it like armor, so that no one can hurt him with it. When Jon angrily asks <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> what he knows about it, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> replies that "all dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."
Eddard and Catelyn receive a letter in the night, delivered to <entidade:Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>>Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade></entidade> by a messenger from the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>. The letter is from Catelyn's sister, Lady <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade>, the widow of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>. In the letter, Lysa says that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was murdered by the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> and that they plan to conspire against <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade>. <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade> counsels that Eddard should accept <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> offer to be <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>, so he can investigate the truth of the matter and protect the King. Eddard, while he would prefer to stay at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, agrees with <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade> and accepts the offer.
The next morning Eddard and Robert go hunting, leaving the castle largely empty. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> indulges in some climbing but, while climbing a broken tower, he hears someone moaning. He peers through a window and finds the queen and her brother engaged in a sexual act. Cersei spots him and warns Jaime, who grabs <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>. Jaime looks out the window to make sure nobody else is watching and only sees <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>. He turns to <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and asks how old he is. When <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> replies "ten," Jaime remarks with a sigh, "The things I do for love." With that, he pushes <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> out of the window.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
In the Free City of <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade>, across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>, <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> and <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> enjoy the hospitality of <entidade:Magister <entidade:Illyrio Mopatis>Illyrio Mopatis</entidade>>Magister <entidade:Illyrio Mopatis>Illyrio Mopatis</entidade></entidade>. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> has arranged to wed his sister Daenerys (also called "<entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>") to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade>, the warlord of a <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> khalasar of forty thousand warriors. In return, Drogo will give <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> the army he needs to reclaim the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> prepares Daenerys for meeting the Khal. He tells her what a beautiful young woman she has turned into, and slips off her dress and fondles her breast. She is silent and looks away as if pretending it isn't happening. She steps into a hot bath that has just been poured. This greatly distresses her maid who believes the water will scald her. However, Daenerys seems not to notice it and appears to be unharmed.

    Drogo arrives in <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> and approves of Daenerys.  
Illyrio and <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> discuss the quest to sail back to <entidade:Westoros>Westoros</entidade>, and <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> inquirers when the wedding will take place. Daenerys is not pleased with the arrangement and blurts out that she does not want to marry Drogo. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> insists that she will, because in return Drogo will give him the army he needs to retake their father's throne from <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade>. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> adds that he would let her be raped by all forty thousand of <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> men and their horses if it meant getting his throne back. A short time later, Drogo arrives at Illyrio's estate. After taking a glance at Daenerys, Drogo rides away without having to dismount from his horse. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> is concerned, but Illyrio assures him that, if he did not approve of Daenerys, they would have known.

    Daenerys in her wedding dress  
Later, Daenerys marries <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> and a great celebration is held. Several people die in impromptu duels, which Illyrio says is a good sign: a <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair. The bride and groom receive many gifts, but for <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>, two are particularly interesting. The first is a box containing three beautiful stones. According to Illyrio, these are dragon eggs from the <entidade:Shadow Lands beyond Asshai>Shadow Lands beyond Asshai</entidade> that have turned to stone with the passing of time. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> appears to feel some connection with the eggs, but brushes it off for the time being. The second is a selection of books containing stories and songs from the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, given by <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, an exiled knight of House <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>. <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> swears fealty to <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> as King and offers him his support and advice, which is accepted. For his gift, Drogo gives Daenerys a beautiful white stallion. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> asks his sister to make Drogo happy. Drogo and Daenerys ride down to the shore and consummate their marriage on the beach at sunset. Daenerys is visibly upset and terrified.
