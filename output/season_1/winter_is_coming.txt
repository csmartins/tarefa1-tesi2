Plot
King <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> majestically arrives in <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, the home of his old and trusted friend, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade>, <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the North, with an important offer.
On the eastern continent, the exiled Princess Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> marries <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade>, a warlord of the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> with tens of thousands of warriors at his command. Her brother, <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade>, callously plans to win Drogo's allegiance with the marriage, so that he may return home to <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> and reclaim the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, which was seized by force from his father by Robert.
In the frozen lands, beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the wildlings are on the move, to the alarm of the Night's Watch. But even farther north, something colder and darker is beginning to stir.

<entidade:Summary>Summary</entidade>
<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
Three rangers of the Night's Watch: Ser <entidade:Waymar Royce>Waymar Royce</entidade>, <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade>, and <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade> depart from the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> to investigate reports of wildlings in the <entidade:Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade>>Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade></entidade> which lies to the north, <entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade>, the best scout in the group, discovers a number of wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground.

    <entidade:Wight>Wight</entidade> of wildling girl.  He also finds a dead wildling girl pinned to a tree. He reports back to the others. Ser Waymar overrides the older <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade>'s advice that they return to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> to report the situation to their superiors and instead insists on seeing the corpses for himself, to determine what killed them. When they reach the site, the bodies have disappeared. <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade> scouts around for clues, but <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade> finds a bloody piece of clothing buried under the snow. Further investigations are curtailed when a tall, humanoid figure with glowing blue eyes, a <entidade:White Walker>White Walker</entidade>, arrives and kills Ser Waymar with ease. <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade> attempts to escape but is caught and killed. <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade>, in extreme horror, sees the dead wildling girl from earlier now walking with blue eyes, and also witnesses <entidade:Gared>Gared</entidade>'s death, with the <entidade:White Walker>White Walker</entidade> tossing his severed head at <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade>'s feet.
In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
    <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned Stark</entidade> draws his sword.  
Some time later, <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade> has fled south of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> in terror, rather than return to warn <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> of the <entidade:White Walker>White Walker</entidade> threat. He is apprehended by outriders loyal to <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade>, the wardens of the North, and is taken to Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade>. Lord Eddard, in the courtyard watching his son, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran Stark</entidade> at archery training, decrees that as a deserter from the Watch, <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade> is an oathbreaker and must die. <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade> accepts his fate, but tells Eddard about the Walkers first and asks that word be sent back to his mother. Eddard carries out the execution himself, using the ancestral Valyrian blade of their house, <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade>. Two of Eddard's trueborn sons, 17-year-old Robb and 10-year-old Bran, accompany him to the execution along with his bastard son <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>, his ward, <entidade:Theon Greyjoy>Theon Greyjoy</entidade>, the master-at-arms <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik Cassel</entidade> and his leading guard <entidade:<entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel><entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel</entidade>. Young Bran witnesses an execution for the first time without flinching, earning praise from Jon. Eddard explains to Bran that the reason he was made to execute <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade> was because the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. When Bran asks his father about <entidade:Willas Bracken>Will</entidade>'s talk of <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, Eddard dismisses it as a madman's ramblings, insisting that the Walkers have been gone for centuries. The party sets out to return to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.

    The <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> come across the <entidade:Direwolves>Direwolves</entidade>.  
On the way back to the castle, the party finds a stag dead in the road, partially disemboweled. Looking for what killed it, they find a dead female direwolf, killed with a stag antler piece broken off in her throat. The female died after giving birth, and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth. Theon advocates killing the pups, but <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> convinces his father that this is an omen: the direwolf is the symbol of <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade>, and Eddard has five trueborn children. With Bran looking on beseechingly, Eddard agrees that his children should have the pups, but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants. Just as the party leaves, Jon finds a sixth pup, an albino runt of the litter. Theon mockingly points out that this one belongs to Jon.
In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, the capital city of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, the bells ring out to commemorate the death of Lord <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>, the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King. As the <entidade:Silent Sisters>Silent Sisters</entidade> prepare his body for burial, Queen <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> looks on. She is worried that Jon discovered something he shouldn't have, and may have told someone. She confesses her fears to her twin brother, Ser <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, but he tells her not to worry, since if the King knew the truth they'd be dead already. She tells him he should be the new <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King, but he doesn't want the job. He considers it too much work. Cersei accuses him of taking nothing seriously.
A raven bears news of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>'s death to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, where <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> informs Eddard. He is particularly stricken because Arryn served as a father-figure to him, when he was fostered at the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>. She also tells him that King <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> and much of the royal court rides for <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Eddard realizes that King Robert means to name him as the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> to replace <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>. He ponders refusing, feeling his place is at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.
Over the next few weeks the Stark children grow used to their rapidly-growing direwolves: Robb names his <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade>, Sansa calls hers <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade>, and Arya names hers Nymeria after a great warrior-queen. Jon names his <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade>, for his white color and uncanny silence. Bran calls his <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> and six-year-old Rickon names his wolf <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade>. Bran's mother catches him climbing on the rooftops of the castle, just as the royal party comes into view. He promises to stop, but his mother knows he is lying. <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> prepares for guests. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> wants to make sure that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade>, a great reader, has enough candles, and the young men of the house get groomed, as they gossip about the queen, a reportedly great beauty.

    <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> gathers to greet the royal party.  
All of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> gathers in the courtyard as the royal party approaches. Arya is late and annoys Sansa by not being silent and respectful when they arrive. King Robert rides in with his knights, while Queen Cersei is in a large wheelhouse. Lord Eddard presents his household to King Robert. Eddard and Robert greet each other warmly, and then Robert demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to Eddard's deceased sister, Lyanna, much to Queen Cersei's impatience. After Robert and Eddard depart, Cersei sends Jaime to find their younger brother Tyrion, who is a dwarf. "The <entidade:Imp>Imp</entidade>" has found his way to the brothel in the town outside <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, where he enjoys the attentions of a prostitute named Ros. Jaime tells Tyrion, a man of limited height but with immense appetites, that he will be needed at the feast that night. Jaime has hired three more prostitutes for Tyrion, to hurry things along.

    Lyanna's statue in the crypts of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.  
In the crypts Robert offers up his prayers at the tomb of <entidade:Lyanna Stark>Lyanna Stark</entidade>, Eddard's younger sister, whom Robert was betrothed to before she was kidnapped by <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Rhaegar <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>>Rhaegar <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade></entidade> and died shortly after being rescued. He tells Eddard that in his dreams he kills Rhaegar every night anew. Eddard reminds him that House <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> was destroyed, but Robert replies: "not all of them."
Robert formally offers Eddard the role of <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>, and Eddard asks for time to consider. Robert agrees, but offers a sweetener: the hand of his son, Joffrey, in marriage to Eddard's daughter, Sansa. A great feast is held and Cersei and Catelyn exchange cordial words. Cersei seems more impressed by Sansa, thinking that she will be a great hit at court. Outside the feast, <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> works at his sword practice, angry that Catelyn thought it would be inappropriate that a bastard should attend. His uncle <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen Stark</entidade>, <entidade:First Ranger>First Ranger</entidade> of the Night's Watch, arrives to join the feast, and Jon asks him to take him back to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> with him. Benjen agrees to consider it. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> then arrives and talks to Jon, suggesting that he is too pricklish and quick to take offense when his illegitimacy is pointed out. He should take the insult and wear it like armor, so that no one can hurt him with it. When Jon angrily asks Tyrion what he knows about it, Tyrion replies that "all dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."
Eddard and Catelyn receive a letter in the night, delivered to <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> by a messenger from the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>. The letter is from Catelyn's sister, <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade>, the widow of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>. In the letter, Lysa says that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was murdered by the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> and that they plan to conspire against King Robert. <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> counsels that Eddard should accept Robert's offer to be <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>, so he can investigate the truth of the matter and protect the King. Eddard, while he would prefer to stay at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, agrees with <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> and accepts the offer.
The next morning Eddard and Robert go hunting, leaving the castle largely empty. Bran indulges in some climbing but, while climbing a broken tower, he hears someone moaning. He peers through a window and finds the queen and her brother engaged in a sexual act. Cersei spots him and warns Jaime, who grabs Bran. Jaime looks out the window to make sure nobody else is watching and only sees <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>. He turns to Bran and asks how old he is. When Bran replies "ten," Jaime remarks with a sigh, "The things I do for love." With that, he pushes Bran out of the window.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
In the Free <entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> of <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade>, across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>, <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> and Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> enjoy the hospitality of Magister <entidade:Illyrio Mopatis>Illyrio Mopatis</entidade>. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> has arranged to wed his sister Daenerys (also called "<entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>") to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade>, the warlord of a <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> khalasar of forty thousand warriors. In return, Drogo will give <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> the army he needs to reclaim the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> prepares Daenerys for meeting the Khal. He tells her what a beautiful young woman she has turned into, and slips off her dress and fondles her breast. She is silent and looks away as if pretending it isn't happening. She steps into a hot bath that has just been poured. <entidade:This>This</entidade> greatly distresses her maid who believes the water will scald her. However, Daenerys seems not to notice it and appears to be unharmed.

    Drogo arrives in <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> and approves of Daenerys.  
Illyrio and <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> discuss the quest to sail back to <entidade:Westoros>Westoros</entidade>, and <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> inquirers when the wedding will take place. Daenerys is not pleased with the arrangement and blurts out that she does not want to marry Drogo. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> insists that she will, because in return Drogo will give him the army he needs to retake their father's throne from <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade>. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> adds that he would let her be raped by all forty thousand of Drogo's men and their horses if it meant getting his throne back. A short time later, Drogo arrives at Illyrio's estate. After taking a glance at Daenerys, Drogo rides away without having to dismount from his horse. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> is concerned, but Illyrio assures him that, if he did not approve of Daenerys, they would have known.

    Daenerys in her wedding dress  
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, Daenerys marries <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> and a great celebration is held. Several people die in impromptu duels, which Illyrio says is a good sign: a <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair. The bride and groom receive many gifts, but for <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>, two are particularly interesting. The first is a box containing three beautiful stones. According to Illyrio, these are dragon eggs from the <entidade:<entidade:Shadow <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade>>Shadow</entidade> Lands><entidade:Shadow <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade>>Shadow</entidade> Lands</entidade> beyond <entidade:Asshai>Asshai</entidade> that have turned to stone with the passing of time. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> appears to feel some connection with the eggs, but brushes it off for the time being. The second is a selection of books containing stories and songs from the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, given by Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade>, an exiled knight of House Mormont. Ser Jorah swears fealty to <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> as King and offers him his support and advice, which is accepted. <entidade:Red Fork>For</entidade> his gift, Drogo gives Daenerys a beautiful white stallion. <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> asks his sister to make Drogo happy. Drogo and Daenerys ride down to the shore and consummate their marriage on the beach at sunset. Daenerys is visibly upset and terrified.
