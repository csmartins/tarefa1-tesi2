With <entidade:Sansaʼs>Sansaʼs</entidade> life in danger, <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> makes a fateful decision. Catelyn brokers an unsavory deal with the slippery <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> acquires a mistress and is forced by his father to fight on the front lines. Robb wins his first major victory and captures a prized prisoner. Jon is rewarded for his valor and discovers a dark secret about <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade>. As <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade>ʼs wound festers, Daenerys defies his bloodrider <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> and puts her trust in the enslaved witch Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade>.


 In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> 
    Theon and Robb outside the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>.  Robb's army has reached the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, the heavily-fortified crossing over the <entidade:Green Fork>Green Fork</entidade> of <entidade:Trident River>Trident River</entidade>. <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> shoots down messenger ravens, so no word of their presence can be relayed, but finds nothing more but messages to extended family members. To enter the castle would be perilous for Robb, so <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> enters to negotiate their crossing the river. 
Though held by <entidade:House Frey>House Frey</entidade>, bannermen to <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade>'s father, Lord <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade> has not yet taken up arms. When called up, he says he had been preparing to march, and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive. In reality, he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved. Now, as the <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade>'s army has been defeated and <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> is held by the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, he wants to know why he should be helping Robb and taking up arms against the king. After some hard bargaining between Catelyn and Walder, they strike a deal: the <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> will join Robb's cause, allow him to cross and commit troops to his army, but in return both Robb and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> must each marry one of <entidade:Walder's>Walder's</entidade> own children. Robb agrees, though noting that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> won't like it. Robb must also take <entidade:<entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> Frey><entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> Frey</entidade> as a squire.                 
The Lannister armies prepare for battle. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> tells his son <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he means to use the hill tribe forces to give them an edge against the Stark army, essentially to be used as cannon fodder. He orders <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to lead them from the front of the vanguard. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him. He storms back to his tent to find that <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> has found him, as per instruction, a whore named <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> takes an immediate liking to her. When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> goes off to find one for himself.                 
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, and <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> play a drinking game the night before the battle. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink. He guesses correctly that <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> has been beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and killed someone before he was twelve years old (though it was a woman, not a man, and he killed her in self-defense, because she was coming at him with an axe). <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> guesses that <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>'s mother was a whore, her father deserted them, and she is low born - however he is wrong on each guess. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> cannot read <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>'s personality, but this only makes her more intriguing to him. When <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> starts to question <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> reveals that he heard <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was once married. Reluctantly, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> explains that when he was very young, he and Jaime were out riding near <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade> and found a young common girl in distress from bandits. While Jaime chased the bandits off, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> comforted the girl, whose name was <entidade:Tysha>Tysha</entidade>. They ended up getting drunk at a local inn, and she became so enamored of him that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> felt like he wasn't an ugly dwarf. Later that night she had sex with <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, the first time he was ever with a woman. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> fell madly in love, and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret.                 

However, two weeks later his father <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> found out, and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> forced Jaime to reveal the truth: the girl was a prostitute and Jaime set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> then instructed his guards to have sex with her, with her being paid a silver coin for each man, while <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was forced to watch. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> points out that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped. As she gets romantic with <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> leaves the tent.    <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> leads the hill tribes into battle.  The next morning the Lannister army finds that the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> have stolen a march on them; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> gives a rousing speech to his hill tribesmen, but as they charge for the front he is first nearly trampled and then knocked out by an accidental blow to the head from someone's club. When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> tells him that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> won the battle, but it was a feint. As a diversion, Robb sent a small portion of his army to confront and delay <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>'s forces, while the main army marched on <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> to attack Jaime's army.    Jaime is captured by Robb's army.      <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade> after his victory.  
Catelyn and <entidade:Ser Rodrik>Ser Rodrik</entidade> Cassel are waiting in woodlands as they hear sounds of battle. Suddenly Robb returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner, Jaime himself. The <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Whispering Wood>Whispering Wood</entidade> has lifted the siege of <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>, and Jaime's army has been destroyed. Jaime suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and Robb, but Robb refuses and has him imprisoned. Robb laments that his diversion sent 2,000 men to their deaths. He gives a speech to his army and tells them that they have won a great victory, but the war is far from over.

 At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
    Jeor <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> gives his sword <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade> to <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>.  At <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> Jeor <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> gives <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> a Valyrian steel sword, <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade>, in thanks for saving his life. <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> also reinstates Jon to his former position and tells him he has dispatched <entidade:Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade>>Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade></entidade> Thorne to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> to lay the hand of the wight they found at the feet of the King and ask for aid. 
    <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade> reveals his true identity.  
<entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> explains to Jon that <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade> was meant for his own son, <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, but he disgraced himself and fled in exile to <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade>. Jon goes to the dining hall and the other recruits make a fuss over the sword, but <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> seems distant from the revelry. Sam takes Jon aside and informs him about Robb leading an army south to war. Jon ponders that he should be with him, but <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade> tells him their duty to the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> comes first. To Jon's surprise, Aemon reveals that his full name is <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon Targaryen</entidade>, the son of a king, brother to another, the uncle of the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade>. Aemon had to stand aside and do nothing while his entire family was butchered or exiled during <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> Rebellion. It is not an easy life they have chosen. Aemon remarks that he cannot make Jon stay or go; like the Maester, Jon must make the choice himself, and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life.

 Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> 
    Drogo after his fall.  Far to the east, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> is concerned that the wound her husband <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> took fighting <entidade:Mago>Mago</entidade> has festered and become infected. He falls from his horse, a grave sign of weakness amongst the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>. Daenerys tells the khalasar that they are stopping and requests for <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> to get Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> to help Drogo. <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> is unhappy with entrusting <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> care to the woman, whom he calls a maegi or witch, but relents.
At Daenerys' request, <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> armors himself. Jorah also advises her to leave now, because Drogo is certain to die and when he dies, his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill Daenerys's son, rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival, but Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband. Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> promises to save <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> life, but she needs to sacrifice a life in exchange. She takes <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> horse into his tent and starts the ceremony, slitting the animal's throat over <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> comatose form.                

    Jorah <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> helps Daenerys.  
Some of <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> warriors become enraged at what they see as Daenerys' attempts to interfere with the natural way of things and <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> tries to attack her, but <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> kills him. Daenerys starts to go into labor, but none of the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> midwives will help her, thinking she is cursed. With no choice, Jorah takes Daenerys into the tent as the ceremony continues.

 In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> visits <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> in the dungeons under the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> tells <entidade:Eddard that Sansa>Eddard that Sansa</entidade> begged for his life before the whole court and that Robb is leading an army from the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. In addition, the Queen is more concerned over the intentions of King <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> brother, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, a proven battle commander known to be without mercy. For the sake of Sansa's life, <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> urges Eddard to confess to treason. In return, Cersei will let him take the black and join his younger brother Benjen and bastard son <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> on the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. Eddard is angered by the suggestion that he would trade in his honesty and honor for his life, though he appears to have second thoughts when <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> insinuates that Sansa would pay the price for his defiance.
<entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> is living rough on the streets of the city. She catches a pigeon and tries to trade it for a slice of bread, to no avail. She sees crowds moving through the streets and is told that the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King is being brought before the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, the center of religious worship in the city. Stunned that she will see her father she drops the pigeon and joins the crowd. Unable to see, she climbs unto the pedestal of a statue of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> (a previous Targaryen king, <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> the <entidade:Blessed>Blessed</entidade>, for whom the Sept is named). She sees her father being brought in chains to the steps of the temple. He sees <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> on the statue, and as he is dragged through the crowd he passes <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> (who had met <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>). <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> looks at the statue and says, "<entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>," puzzling the crowd. <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> understands, however, and moves toward the statue where <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is watching.
Eddard is given a chance to confess his "crimes." He weighs his choices as he sees both <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and Sansa present, and chooses to save them by making a false confession. He says that Joffrey is the true King on the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>, pleasing him. Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> extols the virtues of mercy and Joffrey agrees that he could be merciful and send Eddard to the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> as his mother has suggested and as Sansa has begged. He instead acknowledges that as women they are "soft" and treason must never go unpunished. He commands <entidade:Ser Ilyn>Ser Ilyn</entidade> Payne to bring him the traitor's head.                 

    <entidade:Ser Ilyn>Ser Ilyn</entidade> Payne executes <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade>.  
The crowd goes into an uproar. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> tries to make her way through the crowd drawing her sword to save her father, but <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> grabs and stops her, shielding her from seeing her father's death. Sansa screams and is restrained by guards. A visibly horrified Cersei frantically tries to persuade her son to reconsider, as does <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>, but there is no time. Forced to kneel, Eddard looks at the statue and sees that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> has been rescued by <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade>, and is relieved that she is safe. <entidade:Ser Ilyn>Ser Ilyn</entidade> draws Eddard's own sword, <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade>, and cuts his head off with a single blow. A flock of pigeons takes flight immediately afterwards, the sight being all <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> needs to know her father is dead.
