With Sansaʼs life in danger, <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> makes a fateful decision. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> brokers an unsavory deal with the slippery <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> acquires a mistress and is forced by his father to fight on the front lines. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> wins his first major victory and captures a prized prisoner. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is rewarded for his valor and discovers a dark secret about <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade>. As <entidade:Khal Moro>Khal</entidade> Drogoʼs wound festers, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> defies his bloodrider <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> and puts her trust in the enslaved witch Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade>.


 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> 
    Theon and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> outside the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>.  Robb's army has reached the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, the heavily-fortified crossing over the <entidade:Green Fork>Green Fork</entidade> of <entidade:River Trident>Trident</entidade> River. Theon <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> shoots down messenger ravens, so no word of their presence can be relayed, but finds nothing more but messages to extended family members. To enter the castle would be perilous for <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>, so <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> enters to negotiate their crossing the river. 
Though held by <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Frey</entidade>, bannermen to <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> Stark's father, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade> has not yet taken up arms. When called up, he says he had been preparing to march, and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> reality, he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved. Now, as the Tully's army has been defeated and <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> is held by the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, he wants to know why he should be helping <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> and taking up arms against the king. After some hard bargaining between <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> and <entidade:Black Walder>Walder</entidade>, they strike a deal: the <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> will join Robb's cause, allow him to cross and commit troops to his army, but in return both <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> must each marry one of Walder's own children. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> agrees, though noting that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> won't like it. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> must also take <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar Frey</entidade> as a squire.                 
The <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade> armies prepare for battle. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> tells his son <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that he means to use the hill tribe forces to give them an edge against the <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> army, essentially to be used as cannon fodder. He orders <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to lead them from the front of the vanguard. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him. He storms back to his tent to find that <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> has found him, as per instruction, a whore named <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> takes an immediate liking to her. When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> goes off to find one for himself.                 
Tyrion, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, and <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> play a drinking game the night before the battle. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink. He guesses correctly that <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> has been beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and killed someone before he was twelve years old (though it was a woman, not a man, and he killed her in self-defense, because she was coming at him with an axe). <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> guesses that Shae's mother was a whore, her father deserted them, and she is low born - however he is wrong on each guess. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> cannot read Shae's personality, but this only makes her more intriguing to him. When <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> starts to question <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> reveals that he heard <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was once married. Reluctantly, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> explains that when he was very young, he and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> were out riding near <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade> and found a young common girl in distress from bandits. While <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> chased the bandits off, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> comforted the girl, whose name was <entidade:Tysha>Tysha</entidade>. They ended up getting drunk at a local inn, and she became so enamored of him that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> felt like he wasn't an ugly dwarf. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night she had sex with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, the first time he was ever with a woman. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> fell madly in love, and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret.                 

However, two weeks later his father <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> found out, and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> forced <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> to reveal the truth: the girl was a prostitute and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> then instructed his guards to have sex with her, with her being paid a silver coin for each man, while <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was forced to watch. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> points out that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped. As she gets romantic with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> leaves the tent.    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> leads the hill tribes into battle.  The next morning the <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade> army finds that the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> have stolen a march on them; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> gives a rousing speech to his hill tribesmen, but as they charge for the front he is first nearly trampled and then knocked out by an accidental blow to the head from someone's club. When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> tells him that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> won the battle, but it was a feint. As a diversion, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> sent a small portion of his army to confront and delay Tywin's forces, while the main army marched on <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> to attack Jaime's army.    <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is captured by Robb's army.      <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> after his victory.  
<entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik Cassel</entidade> are waiting in woodlands as they hear sounds of battle. Suddenly <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> himself. The <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Whispering Wood>Whispering Wood</entidade> has lifted the siege of <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>, and Jaime's army has been destroyed. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>, but <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> refuses and has him imprisoned. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> laments that his diversion sent 2,000 men to their deaths. He gives a speech to his army and tells them that they have won a great victory, but the war is far from over.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
    <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> gives his sword <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade> to <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>.  <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> gives <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> a <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> steel sword, <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade>, in thanks for saving his life. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> also reinstates <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> to his former position and tells him he has dispatched Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> to lay the hand of the wight they found at the feet of the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> and ask for aid. 
    <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> reveals his true identity.  
<entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> explains to <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade> was meant for his own son, Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade>, but he disgraced himself and fled in exile to <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> goes to the dining hall and the other recruits make a fuss over the sword, but <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> seems distant from the revelry. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> takes <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> aside and informs him about <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> leading an army south to war. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> ponders that he should be with him, but <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> tells him their duty to the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> comes first. To Jon's surprise, <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> reveals that his full name is <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>, the son of a king, brother to another, the uncle of the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> had to stand aside and do nothing while his entire family was butchered or exiled during Robert's Rebellion. It is not an easy life they have chosen. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> remarks that he cannot make <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> stay or go; like the <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade>, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> must make the choice himself, and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life.

 Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> 
    <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> after his fall.  Far to the east, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> is concerned that the wound her husband <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> took fighting <entidade:Mago>Mago</entidade> has festered and become infected. He falls from his horse, a grave sign of weakness amongst the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> tells the khalasar that they are stopping and requests for <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> to get Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> to help <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>. <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> is unhappy with entrusting Drogo's care to the woman, whom he calls a maegi or witch, but relents.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> Daenerys' request, Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> armors himself. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> also advises her to leave now, because <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade> is certain to die and when he dies, his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill Daenerys's son, rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival, but <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> refuses to abandon her husband. Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> promises to save Drogo's life, but she needs to sacrifice a life in exchange. She takes Drogo's horse into his tent and starts the ceremony, slitting the animal's throat over Drogo's comatose form.                

    <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> helps <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade>.  
Some of Drogo's warriors become enraged at what they see as Daenerys' attempts to interfere with the natural way of things and <entidade:Qotho>Qotho</entidade> tries to attack her, but Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> kills him. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> starts to go into labor, but none of the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> midwives will help her, thinking she is cursed. With no choice, <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> takes <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> into the tent as the ceremony continues.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> visits <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> in the dungeons under the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> tells <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> begged for his life before the whole court and that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> is leading an army from the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> addition, the <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> is more concerned over the intentions of <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> Robert's brother, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, a proven battle commander known to be without mercy. <entidade:Red Fork>For</entidade> the sake of Sansa's life, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> urges <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> to confess to treason. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> return, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> will let him take the black and join his younger brother <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen</entidade> and bastard son <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> on the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> is angered by the suggestion that he would trade in his honesty and honor for his life, though he appears to have second thoughts when <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> insinuates that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> would pay the price for his defiance.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> is living rough on the streets of the city. She catches a pigeon and tries to trade it for a slice of bread, to no avail. She sees crowds moving through the streets and is told that the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> is being brought before the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, the center of religious worship in the city. Stunned that she will see her father she drops the pigeon and joins the crowd. Unable to see, she climbs unto the pedestal of a statue of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> (a previous <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> king, <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> the <entidade:Blessed>Blessed</entidade>, for whom the <entidade:Septa Mordane>Sept</entidade> is named). She sees her father being brought in chains to the steps of the temple. He sees <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> on the statue, and as he is dragged through the crowd he passes <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> (who had met Arya). <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> looks at the statue and says, "Baelor," puzzling the crowd. <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> understands, however, and moves toward the statue where <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is watching.
<entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> is given a chance to confess his "crimes." He weighs his choices as he sees both <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> present, and chooses to save them by making a false confession. He says that <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is the true <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> on the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, pleasing him. Grand <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> extols the virtues of mercy and <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> agrees that he could be merciful and send <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> to the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> as his mother has suggested and as <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> has begged. He instead acknowledges that as women they are "soft" and treason must never go unpunished. He commands Ser <entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn Payne</entidade> to bring him the traitor's head.                 

    Ser <entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn Payne</entidade> executes <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>.  
The crowd goes into an uproar. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> tries to make her way through the crowd drawing her sword to save her father, but <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> grabs and stops her, shielding her from seeing her father's death. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> screams and is restrained by guards. A visibly horrified <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> frantically tries to persuade her son to reconsider, as does <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, but there is no time. <entidade:Forced>Forced</entidade> to kneel, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> looks at the statue and sees that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> has been rescued by <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade>, and is relieved that she is safe. Ser <entidade:Ilyn Payne>Ilyn</entidade> draws Eddard's own sword, <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade>, and cuts his head off with a single blow. A flock of pigeons takes flight immediately afterwards, the sight being all <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> needs to know her father is dead.
