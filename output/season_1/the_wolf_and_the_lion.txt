<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s predicament becomes common knowledge in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, making life difficult for <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade>'s position is already precarious due to a disagreement with <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> Baratheon over plans to assassinate Daenerys before she can rally the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> to invade <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. In the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>, Catelyn is shocked by her sister Lysa's paranoia and distrust.


 In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> 
    <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and his escorts in the hills of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>.  
<entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> has his blindfold removed and finds that their party - augmented by several knights and the sellsword <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> from the <entidade:Crossroads Inn>Crossroads Inn</entidade> - is on the <entidade:Eastern Road>Eastern Road</entidade> en route to the <entidade:<entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> of Arryn><entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> of Arryn</entidade>. Catelyn notes that she said they were riding for <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> often and loudly. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> congratulates her on her cunning, while pointing out that his father will give out a handsome reward for his safe return (a point that clearly piques <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>'s interest). He also says that Lady <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> has gone mad since her husband's death and will try to kill him in the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> also protests his innocence in the attempt on <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s life and points out he'd have to be an idiot to give the assassin his own blade. Before Catelyn can answer, the party comes under attack from one of the hill tribes. Despite taking several losses, the party is able to drive off the attackers. Despite having the opportunity to escape, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> fights, killing his first man during the skirmish, and in doing so saves Catelyn's life. Afterwards, they resume their trek to the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>.

    <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Catelyn in the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>'s <entidade:High Hall>High Hall</entidade>.  
In the <entidade:High Hall>High Hall</entidade> of the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>, Lady <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> holds court on behalf of her young son, Robin. Lysa is furious that Cat has endangered them all by bringing <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> points out that if he is harmed, there will be war with <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade>, but Lysa is unconcerned about his threats, as the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> is strongly-defended and the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade> is impregnable. She orders him sent to the sky cells, three-sided cells with the fourth open to a sheer drop down the mountainside, forcing <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to huddle in a corner and try not to roll out to his death in his sleep.

 In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> is angry about his mother's absence. <entidade:Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>>Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade></entidade> tries to set his mind at rest about the matter, to no avail. However, when <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery, <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade> suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow, of the kind used in mounted combat by the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>, a notion which pleases <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>. 

    <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>>Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade></entidade> discuss geography.  
Elsewhere in the castle, <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> enjoys the attentions of his favorite whore, Ros, but becomes annoyed when she compares his prowess unfavorably to that of <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade>.

 In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> Stark arrives at the tourney ground to speak to <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> about the death of <entidade:Ser Hugh>Ser Hugh</entidade> of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>. Barristan notes that he had no family or friends so he stood the knight's vigil himself for <entidade:Ser Hugh>Ser Hugh</entidade>. Eddard is suspicious of <entidade:Ser Hugh>Ser Hugh</entidade>'s death, wanting to know how he could afford a new set of armor so soon after being made a knight. Barristan reflects on the irony of them being on opposite sides of the war during <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> Rebellion and now they are working together. 

    <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> Selmy and <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> Stark discuss the death of <entidade:Ser Hugh>Ser Hugh</entidade>.  
He also tells Eddard that <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> is planning to joust during the day's activities. Eddard finds <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> tormenting his squire, <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade>, finally sending him off on a snipe hunt in amused disgust. Robert is adamant about fighting in the joust but Eddard tells him that he is too fat for his armor and the other knights would let him win. Robert is forced to admit that he's right but they can at least watch the joust from the stands. 
The first tilt of the day is between the fearsome Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, the <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade>, and the popular 'Knight of the <entidade:Jafer Flowers>Flowers</entidade>', <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> Tyrell. Loras gives a beautiful flower to <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, while <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Renly>Lord Renly</entidade> make a wager on who will win with Renly betting on Loras. Loras is riding a mare that is in-heat, which confuses the <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade>'s horse, causing him to throw his rider. 

    <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> Baratheon is dismayed to find he no longer fits his armor.  
<entidade:Enraged>Enraged</entidade> at having lost, Gregor first decapitates his horse and then attacks <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade>. <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> comes to Loras' defense, preventing his brother from killing him. They exchange several blows, until <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> orders them to cease. Sandor immediately bows to the king, while Gregor storms off the field. <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> declares Sandor the victor of the match to the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>'s discomfort.
In the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade></entidade> meets with Eddard. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> tells him that the king is a fool and will soon be dead unless Eddard can save him. Eddard wants to know why <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> is telling him this now. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> tells him he had to be sure Eddard could be trusted. 
He calls Eddard an honorable and true man, maybe the only one in the city. He also confirms that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was assassinated with a poison called the <entidade:Tears of Lys>Tears of Lys</entidade> because he "started asking questions". <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is chasing cats in accordance with her sword training. She chases one into the dungeons under the castle, where she finds the great dragon skulls of the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> in storage. She hears two men - <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> and <entidade:Magister <entidade:Illyrio Mopatis>Illyrio Mopatis</entidade>>Magister <entidade:Illyrio Mopatis>Illyrio Mopatis</entidade></entidade> of <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> - talking. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> says that events have been set in motion and the lion and the wolf will soon be at each other's throats. <entidade:War>War</entidade> is almost upon the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, as they planned, but it has come too soon. <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> will not invade <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> until his son is born and pronounced healthy, which is still many months away. Illyrio suggests assassinating Eddard to forestall the war, but <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> refuses.

    Sandor, <entidade:Ser Gregor>Ser Gregor</entidade> and <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> at the tournament.  
Afterwards, <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> finds <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> in the <entidade:Great Hall>Great Hall</entidade> staring at the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> reveals that he knows about <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s assistance in Eddard's investigation of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>'s death and reminds <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> of the consequences that may befall him should the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> discover his involvement. In response, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> reveals that he already knows about <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> having met with both Eddard and Illyrio just earlier that day, implying he knows of <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>' allegiances across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>. Their conversation is interrupted by Renly, who informs them that Robert will be joining them at their small council meeting.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> escapes from the dungeon and tries to warn her father about what she overheard but she gets the words muddled up. They are interrupted by <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade>, who has ridden non-stop from the <entidade:Crossroads Inn>Crossroads Inn</entidade> to bring Eddard forewarning of Catelyn's arrest of <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade>. Eddard keeps the information to himself, while <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks <entidade:<entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel><entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel</entidade> about the state of her father's household guard. <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> tells her she does not have to worry about her father's safety.
At the meeting of the small council, <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> tells Eddard that <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. He wants Daenerys, the unborn child, and <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> dead as soon as possible. 

    <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> secretly meets Illyrio under the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>.  
Eddard states that this act would be dishonorable, cowardly, and beneath their dignity. The other members of the council - <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade>, Renly, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> - all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm. <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> orders Eddard to enact the order. He refuses and resigns as the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King, to <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> utter disbelief and fury.
Eddard orders his household to begin packing. As Eddard is packing, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> arrives and offers to take Eddard to the last place <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> went before he "fell ill". Eddard agrees.          
<entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Renly>Lord Renly</entidade>, who are lovers, meet in a bedchamber. Renly complains as Robert is organizing a hunt in the <entidade:Kingswood>Kingswood</entidade>, which will no doubt involve traipsing around the forest for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal. Loras urges Renly to claim the crown himself, offering him the allegiance of his rich and powerful family. Renly dismisses the notion, since he is fourth in line to the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. Loras points out that Joffrey is a monster, that Tommen is only eight and laughs at the notion of Robert and Renly's other brother, <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade></entidade>, ever becoming king, as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster. He also asserts that the people love Renly and want to serve him because he is kind and doesn't revel in violence as his brothers do.
<entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade> and Robert share a rare drink and discussion about the Targaryen threat. Surprisingly, Cersei takes Eddard's side, pointing out that the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> cannot cross the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> as they have no ships. 

    <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> urges Renly to consider his place in the line of succession.  
Robert agrees, but if they land and the knights of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> take shelter behind their castle walls, the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> as their king regardless. Cersei suggests that the unified armies of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> could defeat them but Robert says she underestimates the skill and ability of one army with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. Their discussion moves to <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade> Stark, which surprises Robert, as in seventeen years Cersei has never asked about her. He tells her that <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade>'s death left in him a void that seven kingdoms could not fill. He also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the hold <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade>'s memory has on him, and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like. Cersei says that she felt something for Robert once, even after they lost their first boy, for quite a while. She asks Robert if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers "No".
<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> brings <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> to the last place <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> went before falling ill, which is one of <entidade:Littefinger>Littefinger</entidade>'s brothels. There Eddard meets another one of <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> bastards, this time a girl, and her mother, a blond whore named <entidade:Mhaegen>Mhaegen</entidade>. <entidade:Mhaegen>Mhaegen</entidade> remarks that her child has <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> nose and "black" hair. Eddard asks <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> why <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was searching for <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> bastards but he says he doesn't know, offering the half-hearted guess that maybe Robert suddenly took paternal interest in them. Eddard looks skeptical of that reason.
Leaving the brothel, Eddard, <entidade:<entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel><entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel</entidade>, and the two guards that accompanied them are confronted by a large group of Lannister guardsmen led by Ser <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>. Jaime has heard of <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s arrest and demands an explanation. Eddard says that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was arrested on his orders. 

    Eddard is stabbed through the leg by a Lannister guardsman.  
Jaime threatens to kill Eddard but Eddard points out that if he does, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> will die as well. Jaime acknowledges that this is true, so he says he will settle for killing Eddard's men instead. There is a brief engagement in which Eddard's two guards, <entidade:Heward>Heward</entidade> and Wyl, are killed by Lannister spearmen. In response, <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> and <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> fight and kill five of the Lannister soldiers. <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> engages Jaime but is quickly killed when Jaime stabs him through the eye with a dagger. <entidade:Furious>Furious</entidade>, Eddard crosses swords with Jaime. Jaime is shocked and then exhilarated when the older <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> is not as easily defeated as he expected. However, Jaime gradually starts to grow worried as <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade>'s high level of skill becomes apparent. Just as they are ready to clash again, a Lannister guardsman steps in and stabs Eddard through the leg with a spear, disabling him. Jaime is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman. He departs, telling Eddard he wants his brother back.
