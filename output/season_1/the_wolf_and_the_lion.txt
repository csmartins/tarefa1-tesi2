<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s predicament becomes common knowledge in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, making life difficult for <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade>'s position is already precarious due to a disagreement with King <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> over plans to assassinate Daenerys before she can rally the Dothraki to invade <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. In the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>, Catelyn is shocked by her sister Lysa's paranoia and distrust.


 In the Vale 
    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and his escorts in the hills of the Vale.  
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> has his blindfold removed and finds that their party - augmented by several knights and the sellsword <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> from the <entidade:Crossroads Inn>Crossroads Inn</entidade> - is on the <entidade:Eastern Road>Eastern Road</entidade> en route to the Vale of Arryn. Catelyn notes that she said they were riding for <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> often and loudly. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> congratulates her on her cunning, while pointing out that his father will give out a handsome reward for his safe return (a point that clearly piques <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>'s interest). He also says that <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> has gone mad since her husband's death and will try to kill him in the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> also protests his innocence in the attempt on <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s life and points out he'd have to be an idiot to give the assassin his own blade. Before Catelyn can answer, the party comes under attack from one of the hill tribes. Despite taking several losses, the party is able to drive off the attackers. Despite having the opportunity to escape, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> fights, killing his first man during the skirmish, and in doing so saves Catelyn's life. Afterwards, they resume their trek to the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>.

    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and Catelyn in the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>'s <entidade:High <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>High <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade></entidade>.  
In the <entidade:High <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>High <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade></entidade> of the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>, <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> holds court on behalf of her young son, <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade>. Lysa is furious that Cat has endangered them all by bringing <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to the Vale. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> points out that if he is harmed, there will be war with <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade>, but Lysa is unconcerned about his threats, as the Vale is strongly-defended and the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade> is impregnable. She orders him sent to the sky cells, three-sided cells with the fourth open to a sheer drop down the mountainside, forcing <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to huddle in a corner and try not to roll out to his death in his sleep.

 In the North 
In <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> is angry about his mother's absence. <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> tries to set his mind at rest about the matter, to no avail. However, when <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery, <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow, of the kind used in mounted combat by the Dothraki, a notion which pleases <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>. 

    <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> discuss geography.  
Elsewhere in the castle, Theon Greyjoy enjoys the attentions of his favorite whore, Ros, but becomes annoyed when she compares his prowess unfavorably to that of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade>.

 In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade> arrives at the tourney ground to speak to Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> about the death of Ser <entidade:Hugh>Hugh</entidade> of the Vale. Barristan notes that he had no family or friends so he stood the knight's vigil himself for Ser <entidade:Hugh>Hugh</entidade>. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> is suspicious of Ser <entidade:Hugh>Hugh</entidade>'s death, wanting to know how he could afford a new set of armor so soon after being made a knight. Barristan reflects on the irony of them being on opposite sides of the war during Robert's Rebellion and now they are working together. 

    Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> and Lord <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade> discuss the death of Ser <entidade:Hugh>Hugh</entidade>.  
He also tells <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> that King Robert is planning to joust during the day's activities. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> finds King Robert tormenting his squire, <entidade:Lancel Lannister><entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, finally sending him off on a snipe hunt in amused disgust. Robert is adamant about fighting in the joust but <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> tells him that he is too fat for his armor and the other knights would let him win. Robert is forced to admit that he's right but they can at least watch the joust from the stands. 
The first tilt of the day is between the fearsome Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane><entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> Clegane</entidade>, the <entidade:Mountain That Rides>Mountain</entidade>, and the popular 'Knight of the <entidade:Jafer Flowers>Flowers</entidade>', Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell><entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> Tyrell</entidade>. <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> gives a beautiful flower to <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, while <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> and Lord <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> make a wager on who will win with <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> betting on <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>. <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> is riding a mare that is in-heat, which confuses the <entidade:Mountain That Rides>Mountain</entidade>'s horse, causing him to throw his rider. 

    King <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> is dismayed to find he no longer fits his armor.  
Enraged at having lost, <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> first decapitates his horse and then attacks Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>. <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> comes to <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>' defense, preventing his brother from killing him. They exchange several blows, until King Robert orders them to cease. Sandor immediately bows to the king, while <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> storms off the field. Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> declares Sandor the victor of the match to the Hound's discomfort.
In the <entidade:Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>>Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade></entidade>, Lord <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> meets with <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> tells him that the king is a fool and will soon be dead unless <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> can save him. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> wants to know why <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> is telling him this now. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> tells him he had to be sure <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> could be trusted. 
He calls <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> an honorable and true man, maybe the only one in the city. He also confirms that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was assassinated with a poison called the Tears of Lys because he "started asking questions". Arya is chasing cats in accordance with her sword training. She chases one into the dungeons under the castle, where she finds the great dragon skulls of the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> in storage. She hears two men - <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> and Magister <entidade:Illyrio Mopatis>Illyrio Mopatis</entidade> of <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> - talking. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> says that events have been set in motion and the lion and the wolf will soon be at each other's throats. <entidade:War>War</entidade> is almost upon the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, as they planned, but it has come too soon. <entidade:Khal <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade>>Khal <entidade:Khal Drogo>Drogo</entidade></entidade> will not invade <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> until his son is born and pronounced healthy, which is still many months away. Illyrio suggests assassinating <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> to forestall the war, but <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> refuses.

    Sandor, Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> at the tournament.  
Afterwards, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> finds <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> in the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade></entidade> staring at the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> reveals that he knows about <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s assistance in <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s investigation of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>'s death and reminds <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> of the consequences that may befall him should the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> discover his involvement. In response, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> reveals that he already knows about <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> having met with both <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> and Illyrio just earlier that day, implying he knows of <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>' allegiances across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>. Their conversation is interrupted by <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>, who informs them that Robert will be joining them at their small council meeting.
Arya escapes from the dungeon and tries to warn her father about what she overheard but she gets the words muddled up. They are interrupted by <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade>, who has ridden non-stop from the <entidade:Crossroads Inn>Crossroads Inn</entidade> to bring <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> forewarning of Catelyn's arrest of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade>. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> keeps the information to himself, while Arya asks <entidade:Jory Cassel><entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel</entidade> about the state of her father's household guard. <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> tells her she does not have to worry about her father's safety.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the meeting of the small council, King Robert tells <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> that Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. He wants Daenerys, the unborn child, and <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> dead as soon as possible. 

    <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> secretly meets Illyrio under the <entidade:Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>>Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade></entidade>.  
<entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> states that this act would be dishonorable, cowardly, and beneath their dignity. The other members of the council - <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade>, <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> - all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm. King Robert orders <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> to enact the order. He refuses and resigns as the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King, to Robert's utter disbelief and fury.
<entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> orders his household to begin packing. As <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> is packing, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> arrives and offers to take <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> to the last place <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> went before he "fell ill". <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> agrees.          
Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> and Lord <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>, who are lovers, meet in a bedchamber. <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> complains as Robert is organizing a hunt in the <entidade:Kingswood>Kingswood</entidade>, which will no doubt involve traipsing around the forest for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal. <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> urges <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> to claim the crown himself, offering him the allegiance of his rich and powerful family. <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> dismisses the notion, since he is fourth in line to the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> points out that Joffrey is a monster, that <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> is only eight and laughs at the notion of Robert and <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>'s other brother, Lord <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, ever becoming king, as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster. He also asserts that the people love <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> and want to serve him because he is kind and doesn't revel in violence as his brothers do.
Queen Cersei and Robert share a rare drink and discussion about the <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> threat. Surprisingly, Cersei takes <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s side, pointing out that the Dothraki cannot cross the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> as they have no ships. 

    Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> urges <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> to consider his place in the line of succession.  
Robert agrees, but if they land and the knights of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> take shelter behind their castle walls, the Dothraki could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> as their king regardless. Cersei suggests that the unified armies of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> could defeat them but Robert says she underestimates the skill and ability of one army with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. Their discussion moves to <entidade:Lyanna Stark><entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> Stark</entidade>, which surprises Robert, as in seventeen years Cersei has never asked about her. He tells her that <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade>'s death left in him a void that seven kingdoms could not fill. He also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the hold <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade>'s memory has on him, and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like. Cersei says that she felt something for Robert once, even after they lost their first boy, for quite a while. She asks Robert if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers "No".
<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> brings <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade> to the last place <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> went before falling ill, which is one of Littefinger's brothels. There <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> meets another one of Robert's bastards, this time a girl, and her mother, a blond whore named <entidade:Mhaegen>Mhaegen</entidade>. <entidade:Mhaegen>Mhaegen</entidade> remarks that her child has Robert's nose and "black" hair. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> asks <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> why <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> was searching for Robert's bastards but he says he doesn't know, offering the half-hearted guess that maybe Robert suddenly took paternal interest in them. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> looks skeptical of that reason.
Leaving the brothel, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>, <entidade:Jory Cassel><entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> Cassel</entidade>, and the two guards that accompanied them are confronted by a large group of Lannister guardsmen led by Ser <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>. Jaime has heard of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s arrest and demands an explanation. <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> says that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was arrested on his orders. 

    <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> is stabbed through the leg by a Lannister guardsman.  
Jaime threatens to kill <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> but <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> points out that if he does, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> will die as well. Jaime acknowledges that this is true, so he says he will settle for killing <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s men instead. There is a brief engagement in which <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade>'s two guards, <entidade:Heward>Heward</entidade> and <entidade:Wylla>Wyl</entidade>, are killed by Lannister spearmen. In response, <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> and <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> fight and kill five of the Lannister soldiers. <entidade:Jory Cassel>Jory</entidade> engages Jaime but is quickly killed when Jaime stabs him through the eye with a dagger. Furious, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> crosses swords with Jaime. Jaime is shocked and then exhilarated when the older <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> is not as easily defeated as he expected. However, Jaime gradually starts to grow worried as <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade>'s high level of skill becomes apparent. Just as they are ready to clash again, a Lannister guardsman steps in and stabs <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> through the leg with a spear, disabling him. Jaime is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman. He departs, telling <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> he wants his brother back.
