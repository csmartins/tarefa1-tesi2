    <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> prepares to depart for the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>.  
<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> depart <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> for the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, and along the way Jon discovers his ideas of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> may not match the reality.
<entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> and his daughters depart for <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, but an incident on the <entidade:Kingsroad>Kingsroad</entidade> threatens to drive a wedge between him and <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade>.


Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
The <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> khalasar led by <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> have departed <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> and are heading east. They travel away from the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade></entidade> and into the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> sea, the long-grassed plains that the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> call home. <entidade:<entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> Targaryen><entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> Targaryen</entidade> accompanies the khalasar, meaning to stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and provides him with an army with which to invade <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, despite <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>'s suggestion. He tells <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> that he offended his liege lord, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade>, by selling poachers into slavery. When he received word that Eddard meant to execute him for the crime (slavery has been illegal in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> for centuries), he fled to <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade>. <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> laughs at the notion, saying such trivialities would not be punished under his reign. Daenerys is finding adapting to her new role as khaleesi to be a huge challenge. Only <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> offers her some solace; saying it will become easier. Daenerys is however fearful of her new husband and it is revealed that their first sexual encounter has left her slightly injured.
Fascinated with her gift from Illyrio, <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> asks her handmaidens if they have ever heard of dragons surviving in the east. They reply no, but <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade>, a former pleasure-girl from Lys, tells her an old story about how there used to be two moons in the sky. <entidade:One>One</entidade> wandered too close to the sun and cracked like an egg, spilling out thousands of dragons into the world. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>'s <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> handmaidens <entidade:Irri>Irri</entidade> and <entidade:Jhiqui>Jhiqui</entidade> dismiss the story, saying that the moon is a goddess, wife to the sun.
Daenerys seeks the advice of her handmaid <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade>. <entidade:Doreah>Doreah</entidade> instructs Daenerys on how to please Drogo in bed but also how to use her skills to gain respect from him. Reminding her, "you are no slave" and should not have sex like one. Daenerys nervously puts these plans into action and is surprised to find Drogo responsive, particularly once she starts using her body in combination with the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> language to speak to him.

In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
    <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade> says farewell to Jon.  
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> lies unconscious and badly wounded, his mother by his side. <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> insists that his nephew Joffrey pay his respects to Lord and <entidade:Lady Stark>Lady Stark</entidade>, since his absence has been noted. When Joffrey refuses, saying the boy means nothing to him, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> slaps him three times until he accepts his uncle's suggestion. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> then breakfasts with his other family members, informing them of his decision to journey north to see the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> before returning to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. He also tells them that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> is expected to live and notes Cersei and Jaime's guarded reactions.
Cersei visits <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade>, sitting by her son's side, and tells her that her first child, a beautiful, black-haired boy, died of a fever. She and Robert were grief-stricken and her prayers and tears were for naught. She offers to pray for <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s survival, hoping that this time the gods will listen.
<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> has <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>'s blacksmith, <entidade:Mikken>Mikken</entidade>, forge a light sword for his sister, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is excited by the gift and names it <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade>. Jon also gives her advice on how to best use the weapon: "Stick them with the pointy end." Jon urges <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> to practice every chance she gets. Jon then says goodbye to the comatose <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>, before departing at his stepmother's cold request. Eddard then says his goodbyes to his son and to Catelyn, who is angered at his departure while <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> remains ill.       

    The two parties depart <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.  
The parties depart <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>: Jon, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen Stark</entidade> to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>; and Eddard, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, Sansa and the royal party south to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. At their parting Eddard tells Jon that, though he does not have Eddard's name, he has his blood. He also promises Jon to tell him about his mother the next time they meet.       

    <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> says goodbye to his bastard son.  
Days later, on the <entidade:Kingsroad>Kingsroad</entidade> south to the capital, <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> Baratheon calls a halt to discuss with Eddard some dire news that has just arrived. <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> spies have learned of <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade>'s marriage to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade>, whose khalasar is reported to number over one hundred thousand warriors. Eddard points out that the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> cannot cross the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>, as they have no ships, but Robert is concerned that the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> will soon face another war. A curious Robert asks <entidade:Eddard about Wylla>Eddard about Wylla</entidade>, the mother of his bastard son, but Eddard refuses to enlighten him. Robert reminds him that they were in the middle of a war and no one knew if they would ever return to their families.
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, Catelyn's refusal to leave <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s side is starting to cause problems for the smooth running of the castle. Robb offers to work with <entidade:Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>>Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade></entidade> to put the castle to rights. There is then a fire in part of the castle, but this proves to be a distraction to allow an assassin to attempt to finish off <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>. Catelyn holds the assassin off long enough for <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s direwolf to enter the chamber and tear out the assassin's throat.

    Jon and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> discussing matters.  
Traveling north, Jon and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> talk, and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> reveals that he reads books to sharpen his mind, his greatest asset and weapon. As it travels north, the party is joined by several, new recruits — rapists who chose to "take the black," rather than face the knife. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> tells Jon that the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> is not a noble institution of glorious knights defending the realm against the horrors lurking beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, but a dumping ground for the unwanted and for criminals.
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, Catelyn goes to the tower from where <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> fell and finds a strand of blonde hair on the floor. She summons Robb, Theon, <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade> and the castle master at arms, <entidade:Ser Rodrik>Ser Rodrik</entidade> Cassel and tells them that she suspects that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> tried to kill <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> because he might have seen something in the tower. Robb and Theon are all for making war, but <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade> schools them to caution. Catelyn decides that <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> must know the truth and resolves to travel south to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> and meet him there. <entidade:Ser Rodrik>Ser Rodrik</entidade> will go as escort, while Robb will take charge of the castle in her absence.       

    The <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, as seen by Jon's party.  
Jon's party crests a rise and sees the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> before them. Benjen welcomes them, and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> seems impressed by the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>'s sheer size.
On the <entidade:Kingsroad>Kingsroad</entidade>, the royal party reaches the <entidade:Crossroads Inn>Crossroads Inn</entidade>, a noted waystop on the way south to the capital. <entidade:Prince Joffrey>Prince Joffrey</entidade>'s bodyguard, <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade>, known as "the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>," a man with half his face burned in a mysterious accident, introduces Sansa to <entidade:Ser Ilyn>Ser Ilyn</entidade> Payne, the king's headsman, a frightening-looking man who had his tongue torn out on the orders of the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade> many years ago. Joffrey saves Sansa from this unpleasantness and takes her for a walk along the riverbank. They find <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> practicing her sword work with the son of the party's butcher, <entidade:Mycah>Mycah</entidade>. Joffrey pretends to take offense at <entidade:Mycah>Mycah</entidade> using a sword on the sister of his betrothed and starts to gleefully cut <entidade:Mycah>Mycah</entidade>'s face with his sword, but an outraged <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> hits him on the head with a stick. Joffrey quickly becomes violent and threatens <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> at sword point, but before he can hurt her, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s direwolf, Nymeria, attacks Joffrey, biting at his arm. <entidade:Mycah>Mycah</entidade> runs off, and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> throws Joffrey's sword in the river before running off herself. Sansa tries to help Joffrey, but he spitefully tells her to leave him alone and go for help.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, knowing that Nymeria will be punished for injuring the prince, forces the direwolf to flee by throwing a rock at her. She is then taken before the King, who is angered that a minor fracas has become a major incident, with his wife and new <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> blaming one another's children. He decides to let <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> discipline <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> while he will do the same to Joffrey, but Cersei demands that the direwolf be executed. When Nymeria cannot be found, Cersei spitefully requests that Sansa's direwolf Lady be killed instead, and Robert acquiesces, upsetting Sansa and angering <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>.
<entidade:Furious>Furious</entidade>, Eddard attends to the matter himself, passing the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> arriving with <entidade:Mycah>Mycah</entidade>'s bloodied corpse. Eddard is shocked and disgusted, and when he asks if the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> ran <entidade:Mycah>Mycah</entidade> down, the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> responds "He ran, but not very fast." Eddard kills Lady with a dagger, and hundreds of miles away, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> awakens.
