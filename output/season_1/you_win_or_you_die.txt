    The Lannister army, poised to invade the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>.  
<entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade>'s investigations in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> reach a dramatic climax as he confronts <entidade:Queen Cersei>Queen Cersei</entidade> with his findings. <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> prepares his forces for battle and gives Jaime an important assignment. <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>'s actions inspire <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> to make an important vow. <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> finally takes his place amongst the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>.


 At the <entidade:Lannister Camp>Lannister Camp</entidade> 
On the borders of the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, Lord <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> has assembled an army of sixty thousand men, with which he plans to oppose the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> and punish Catelyn's capture of his son <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade>. 

    <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> discusses the future of <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> with his son Jaime.  
As he stands in his tent skinning a dead stag, he tells his elder son, Jaime, that this conflict will decide the fate of their family; they will either forge a dynasty that will last a thousand years or cease to exist, as the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> had done. He orders Jaime to become the man he was meant to be, and to take thirty thousand men and besiege <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>, Catelyn's childhood home and the seat of <entidade:House <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade>>House <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade></entidade>. Jaime ponders why <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> would risk so much for the ugly, stunted son that he hates, but to <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> a Lannister is a Lannister - even though he considers <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> the least worthy member of their family, any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak.

 In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
    Theon attempts to intimidate <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade>.  
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> attempts to bully <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade>, the wildling woman captured in the recent raid. He insists that she refer to him as "My Lord", but she is unimpressed with his antics. She points out that he is not entitled to this, as his father is still alive. <entidade:Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>>Maester <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade></entidade> dismisses Theon and questions <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> about why her band crossed the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and were fleeing "as far south as south goes". She claims that the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers have awoken after a millennia asleep and are coming south, to <entidade:Maester Luwin>Luwin</entidade>'s skepticism.

 At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> are standing watch atop the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> when Benjen's horse is spotted returning, but, to Jon's horror, there is no sign of Benjen himself.        
Later on, <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> Jeor <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> names the trainees as men of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. He hands out assignments, but to Jon's disgust he is being sent to the stewards, not the rangers. He will work directly for the <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> as his personal steward. His attempts to plead his case to <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade> (who has selected Samwell as his own steward) are met with indifference. However, Sam suggests to Jon that while this move was possibly orchestrated by <entidade:Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade>>Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade></entidade> Thorne to punish Jon, it is also an opportunity for the <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> to groom Jon directly for command. Both are then surprised when <entidade:Pypar>Pypar</entidade> admits that he was sent to the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> for refusing to give sexual favors to a lord, not for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister as he had previously claimed. Nothing about being sent to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> is fair.        

    <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> swear their oaths to the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>.  
<entidade:Convinced>Convinced</entidade>, Jon, along with Sam, say their oath of fealty to the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> in front of a heart tree just inside the eaves of the <entidade:Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade>>Haunted <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade></entidade> and are acknowledged as men of the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. Sam decided to take the oath with Jon to the <entidade:Old <entidade:Old Gods>Gods</entidade>>Old <entidade:Old Gods>Gods</entidade></entidade> of the <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade>, as the Seven gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him. After they take their oaths, <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> finds a severed hand in the woods and brings it back to Jon and a horrified Sam.

 Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> 
    Daenerys tries to convince Drogo to invade <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>.  
    The wine seller is captured after trying to poison Daenerys.  In <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>, Daenerys attempts to convince <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> about the benefits of an invasion of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, but Drogo is reluctant to cross the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>, despite the thousands of ships they could find in the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade></entidade> to do the job. He says that a man doesn't need an "iron chair" but only a horse. Daenerys travels to the marketplace with <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> and her handmaidens. She asks Jorah to help convince her husband since the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> are hers by birthright but he reminds her that her ancestor <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> the <entidade:Conqueror>Conqueror</entidade> took six of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, because he was capable of doing so (due to his dragons), nothing more. Jorah is delivered a message from <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>, a royal pardon for his crimes; he quickly realizes that this news would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy. Seeing Daenerys with a wineseller who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the <entidade:Arbor>Arbor</entidade>, Jorah realizes that the wine has been poisoned; this is the assassination attempt. Having second thoughts, he steps in and stops Daenerys from drinking it. The wineseller attempts to flee, but <entidade:Rakharo>Rakharo</entidade> brings him down with a bolo tangling his ankles.
With the wine seller captured, Ser Jorah tells Daenerys that Robert Baratheon will never stop trying to kill her and her future children. Drogo quickly arrives in the tent. He glares at the seller and then goes to Daenerys to ensure she is okay, before offering Jorah the reward of any horse he chooses for foiling the assassination. <entidade:Angered>Angered</entidade>, he begins to yell out in <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> that his army will cross the "poison water" as no khalasar has done before and take the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> for his son. <entidade:Drogo's>Drogo's</entidade> khalasar departs <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade> the next morning, with the wine seller tied naked to the saddle of Daenerys' horse, forced to walk until he eventually falls of exhaustion and is dragged to his death.

 In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> Stark meets with <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade>. He tells her that he knows the secret that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade> died for: that Cersei's three children are not <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade>, but the product of incest between her and Jaime. Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it, comparing their love to the old Targaryen practice of marrying brother to sister; she also admits to having despised Robert ever since their wedding night, when Robert drunkenly stumbled into Cersei's bed and called her "<entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade>". Eddard angrily tells her to take her children and leave the city immediately. When Robert returns from his hunt, he will tell him the truth of the matter and Cersei should run as far as she can before that happens, lest <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> wrath find her. 
Cersei icily calls <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> a fool for turning down the throne himself after the sack of <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. Eddard tells her that he has regrets, but that isn't one of them. Cersei departs with a chilling warning: "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."
In one of his brothels, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> instructs the newly-arrived Ros and another prostitute, <entidade:Armeca>Armeca</entidade>, on how to please their customers and make them happy. When they ask him to join them, he refuses, saying that he only ever had eyes for one woman. He tells them about his past, how he loved and fought a duel for a woman. He lost and subsequently realized that he could never beat those in power by honorable means, as they would never let him compete on equal terms. When Ros asks him what he wants, he says, "<entidade:Oh>Oh</entidade>, everything."        

    <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> signs a document confirming <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> as Protector of the <entidade:Realm>Realm</entidade>.  Renly finds Eddard and tells him that Robert has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive. Eddard finds Robert telling Joffrey that he wishes he could have been a better father to him. Eddard chooses not to tell Robert about his discoveries to spare his final hours from pain. Robert instructs Eddard to take a letter naming him as the <entidade:Lord Protector>Lord Protector</entidade> of the <entidade:Realm>Realm</entidade>, to rule until Joffrey comes of age. Eddard does not write Joffrey's name, instead saying "the rightful heir". Robert also asks him to cancel the attempt on <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade>'s life. Leaving the chamber, Eddard talks to <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>, who slyly points out that <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade> ensured the King kept "refreshed" with alcohol during the hunt, meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> also says it is far too late to stop the attempt on Daenerys' life.        
    The letter <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> sends to <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon, informing him of his findings.  
At <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, Renly confronts Eddard and offers him a hundred swords to take the queen and her children into custody, but Eddard refuses to dishonor <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> last hours by shedding blood in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> and taking frightened children hostage. Renly suggests that he could make a good king, but Eddard angrily points out that <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> is Renly's older brother and the true heir. In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade></entidade> and instructs a courier to take the message to <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s island fortress. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> then arrives and talks to Eddard, who tells him the truth about Joffrey's parentage. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> suggests that they keep quiet, acknowledge Joffrey as king and make him their puppet. If he proves intractable, they can reveal the truth and crown the more malleable Renly instead. Eddard considers this treason. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> realizes that even though <entidade:Lord Eddard>Lord Eddard</entidade> has <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> edict naming him <entidade:Queen Regent>Regent</entidade> and Protector of the <entidade:Realm>Realm</entidade>, he doesn't have the men he needs to seize control from Cersei. He needs the loyalty of the City <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> understands that the honorable <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> can't come right out and ask him to bribe them, but agrees to do what needs to be done.     
    <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> confronts <entidade:King Joffrey>King Joffrey</entidade> in the throne room.  
In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, Eddard is summoned to the throne room by "<entidade:King Joffrey>King Joffrey</entidade>"; Robert has died. He arrives to find <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> waiting for him, along with Commander <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade> and a detachment of the City <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> tells him that Renly has fled the city, along with <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> Tyrell and a number of retainers. They were last seen heading south. The party enters the throne room, where Joffrey sits on the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. He demands oaths of fealty from his councilors and subjects. Instead, Eddard gives <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> Selmy the proclamation naming him as <entidade:Lord Protector>Lord Protector</entidade> of the <entidade:Realm>Realm</entidade>. To Barristan's shock, Cersei takes the "paper shield" and tears it up. Instead, she suggests that Eddard bend the knee and swear allegiance. In return he will be allowed to return to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Eddard responds that Joffrey has no claim to the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> and commands Slynt to take the Queen and her son into custody. Instead, the City <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> kill Eddard's bodyguards and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> holds a knife to his throat, saying, "I did warn you not to trust me."
