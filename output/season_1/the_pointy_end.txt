In the aftermath of Nedʼs capture, <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> and Arya face off against Lannister guards, while Cersei manipulates Sansa to her own ends. Robb rallies his fatherʼs northern bannermen against <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> and heads south to war. Tyrion forms an uneasy alliance with the hill tribes and reunites with his father. Jon lashes out at Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> and battles a mysterious attacker from beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> is forced to reconcile her desire to conquer <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> with Drogoʼs savagery after the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> raid a peaceful village.


 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
Jon and Sam return to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> with their party and two dead bodies in tow. The two corpses are identified as members of <entidade:Benjen Stark>Benjen Stark</entidade>'s missing ranging party, <entidade:Jafer <entidade:Jafer Flowers>Flowers</entidade>>Jafer <entidade:Jafer Flowers>Flowers</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:Othor>Othor</entidade>. Though the deceased appear to have been dead for some time, Sam astutely notes that the bodies do not smell like they have been rotting. Jon and several other <entidade:Sworn Brothers>Sworn Brothers</entidade> urge Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor Mormont</entidade> to burn the bodies, but he refuses, wanting <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> to examine them.. 
Jon is summoned to Mormont's chambers as news has arrived of Eddard's arrest and imprisonment. After being given the letter to read for himself, a speechless Jon attempts to leave before Mormont reminds him of the oath he has sworn to the Night's Watch. When Jon expresses concern for his sisters, Mormont replies he is sure they are unharmed, though Jon is doubtful.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> on, <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> taunts Jon that his father is a traitor, calling him, "not just a bastard, a traitor's bastard." Jon angrily charges at him with a knife and Thorne is only saved by <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> and <entidade:Pyp>Pyp</entidade> holding Jon back. <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> Mormont witnessed the incident and confines Jon to quarters for his trouble. That night, Jon is aroused by a whining <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> scratching at the door. Sensing trouble, Jon and his direwolf head to the Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade>'s chambers where Jon is confronted by a wight, the reanimated corpse of the dead Night's <entidade:Watchman>Watchman</entidade>. Though Jon is able to stab the wight through the chest with his sword, the wight simply removes the sword and is unharmed. Mormont appears, seeking out the commotion. Jon grabs Mormont's oil lamp and throws it at the wight, finally destroying it.
The morning after, the two wight bodies have been thoroughly burned. Sam says he read in a book that the dead are animated by the touch of the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> and only fire can destroy such creatures. He hopes the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> is big enough to hold them back when the Walkers come in force.

 In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>, Catelyn is furious with Lysa: first for Lysa not immediately notifying her about Eddard's arrest and second for refusing to consider summoning the knights of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> to war. Despite setting in motion this chain of events with her letter to her sister regarding the murder of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon Arryn</entidade>, Lysa does not believe that war is in the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>'s best interests and rather want the knights to stay in the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> to protect her son and their Lord.
Tyrion and <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> have reached the western edge of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> and are surrounded by members of the hill tribes, led by a fearsome warrior named <entidade:Shagga>Shagga</entidade>. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> first he orders them to be killed, but Tyrion does some fast-talking and convinces the hill tribes that <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> is an enemy of the <entidade:House Arryn>House Arryn</entidade> and its rulers. He proposes an alliance which will allow the tribes to enact vengeance against <entidade:House Arryn>House Arryn</entidade> and take ownership of the lands of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>. They eagerly agree, and escort Tyrion and <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> westwards towards where the Lannister armies are gathering.

 In the North 
    Dozens of ravens leaving <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, summoning the banners of the North to war.  
Robb receives a letter from Sansa in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, asking him to pledge fealty to King Joffrey. <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Luwin>Luwin</entidade> correctly deduces the letter is actually the work of the Queen. Robb refuses to consider the request and sends out ravens, summoning the lords bannermen of the North and their armies to assemble at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Released ravens fill the sky. 
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, Robb holds a feast for several of his newly-arrived bannermen. Jon <entidade:Umber>Umber</entidade> assumes that he will lead the vanguard, and is offended by the suggestion that he would be made to march behind a <entidade:Glover>Glover</entidade>, threatening to withdraw from the host. In response, Robb promises that, after the conflict with the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, he will oust <entidade:Greatjon>Greatjon</entidade> from his keep and hang him for breaking his oaths to <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade>; when the enraged bannerman goes to draw a weapon, Robb's direwolf <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade> sets upon him, biting off two of his fingers. Robb recites 'that it [is] death to bear steel against your liege lord' but then diffuses the situation by excusing <entidade:Greatjon>Greatjon</entidade>'s aggression, saying that 'doubtless, the <entidade:Greatjon>Greatjon</entidade> only meant to cut my meat for me'. The <entidade:Greatjon>Greatjon</entidade> roars with laughter and accepts Robb's commands, much to the shock of Bran, who witnessed the entire incident. Robb says farewell to Bran and to Rickon, who is convinced he'll see neither Robb nor his parents again.
Bran prays by the heart tree when he is approached by <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> who tells him the <entidade:Old Gods>Old Gods</entidade> of the <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade> are listening to him and that the wildlings also worship the <entidade:Old Gods>Old Gods</entidade>. She laments that the <entidade:South>South</entidade> has lost touch with the past; the southern Weirwoods were cut down years ago and the <entidade:Southerners>Southerners</entidade> have no idea what's awakening in the north. They are interrupted by <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> who was bathing and has forgotten to put his clothes back on, and <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> remarks that he might have giant blood in him before Bran sends him away. Curious, Bran asks her if giants live beyond the wall. She affirms they do, as well has many other beings, though not all of them are friendly. She asserts that the army Robb has gathered should be marching north, not south. 
Catelyn and Ser <entidade:Rodrik Cassel>Rodrik Cassel</entidade> intercept Robb's army in the <entidade:Neck>Neck</entidade> as it presses southwards. Robb initially exclaims with excitement upon seeing his mother, but stops short of embracing her lest he look weak in front of his bannermen. Catelyn looks at her son with understanding, later embracing once their liege-lords have left their tent. She tells Robb he has no choice but to go to war. However, he cannot lose, for the sake of Ned, Sansa, and Arya, as if he is defeated, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> will show their family no mercy. 
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> on, Robb and his lords are debating on the route of their march, and on whether to march directly against Tywin's army or against Jaime's army besieging <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>. To get to Jaime, they need to cross the <entidade:Green Fork>Green Fork</entidade> of the <entidade:River Trident>River Trident</entidade>, and the only crossing is at the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, held by the notoriously prickly and easily-offended Lord <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade>. A Lannister scout is captured, and Robb sends him back to warn Lord Tywin that twenty thousand <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> soldiers are marching against him. 

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Lannister <entidade:Lannister Camp>Camp</entidade>>Lannister <entidade:Lannister Camp>Camp</entidade></entidade> 
    <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> greet Tyrion and his companions.  Tyrion, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, <entidade:Shagga>Shagga</entidade> and the rest of the hill tribesmen arrive at the Lannister encampment, to find Lord <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> and his brother, Ser <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade>, planning to engage the Stark army, which is moving south from the <entidade:Neck>Neck</entidade>. Tywin shows no sign of relief that his son is alive. Tywin accepts the aid of the hill tribesmen, but <entidade:Shagga>Shagga</entidade> will only fight if Tyrion fights alongside them, a prospect which Tywin welcomes and terrifies Tyrion.
 Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> 
    <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> disciplines <entidade:Mago>Mago</entidade>.      Daenerys notes Drogo's injury.  In <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade>, <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> having taken an oath to take the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, has begun his march of conquest to the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>. The <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> raid a village in <entidade:Lhazar>Lhazar</entidade>, a peaceful country to the south-east of <entidade:Vaes Dothrak>Vaes Dothrak</entidade>. To finance the war to come, they must raid villages and take people to sell into slavery, thereby gaining the money to hire ships for the khalasar to assault <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. Ser Jorah and others try to explain this to Daenerys, but she is disturbed to see the aftermath, the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> killing the villagers and raping their women, and orders it stopped. The <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> grow angry at not being able to take the spoils of victory, as that is the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> way. She starts claiming all the women they see to protect them. The angry warriors take their complaints to <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade>, but he is amused at his wife's fierceness. He tells them that Daenerys may keep the women she has claimed, they can find others. One man won't listen, and angrily accuses Drogo of being slave to a foreign whore. <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> stops the complaints by killing <entidade:Mago>Mago</entidade>, the offended warrior who challenges him. Drogo takes a deep wound to the chest in the process. Though Drogo dismisses it as a scratch, Daenerys insists it be treated and allows one of the women she rescued, a healer called Mirri Maz <entidade:Duur>Duur</entidade> to treat the wound, despite the distaste of Drogo's bloodriders, who derisively call the woman maegi (a witch).
 In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
Lannister soldiers complete their purge of the Stark guards and household staff. Sansa and <entidade:Septa Mordane>Septa Mordane</entidade> hear sounds of fighting. When they are confronted by Lannister guardsmen led by <entidade:<entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> Clegane><entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> Clegane</entidade>, <entidade:Septa Mordane>Septa Mordane</entidade> tells Sansa to run and lock herself in her room while she stays to confront them. However, <entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> later finds and takes Sansa into custody.       

    <entidade:<entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade> confronts Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> and Lannister guards.  
More Lannister guardsmen, this time led by Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, interrupt a "dancing" lesson between <entidade:<entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade> and Arya. <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> holds Arya back, questioning why Lord Eddard would send Lannister men to find Arya. She then refuses to go with them, and when they try to force the issue <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> disarms and disables all of the lightly-armored guardsmen with his wooden practice sword. He tells Arya to run as he faces down Trant, noting that for himself, "the First <entidade:Sword>Sword</entidade> of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> does not run." <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade>'s fate after this is unclear.
Arya runs to the stables where the men waiting with their baggage were supposed to be to take them to the ship for <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. The men are dead, but she finds her real sword, <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade>, in the bottom of her trunk. Arya then starts to leave the stables. (Arya knows how to get out of the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> via the tunnel under the castle that she found when she was chasing cats and followed the two conspirators). When a stableboy tries to grab her, Arya turns around brandishing <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> and accidentally runs him through and kills him. <entidade:Horrified>Horrified</entidade>, she flees.
<entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> visits <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> in his cell in the dungeons. He is incredulous that Eddard trusted <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> over him, and even more so that he warned Cersei what he was going to do. Eddard says he wanted to extend mercy to Cersei's children, whom Robert would have killed if he'd known the truth. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> bluntly tells Eddard that his mercy is what killed King Robert, to Eddard's shame. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> then tells him that Catelyn also no longer holds Tyrion as her prisoner, meaning that the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> have nothing to barter with for Eddard's life. When Eddard suggests they should just kill him, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> says "Not today, my lord." As he departs, Eddard asks <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> who he truly serves: <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, in a rare display of honesty, replies "The realm, my lord. Someone must."
Cersei and the remainder of the small council, comprised of Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> Pycelle, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>, summon Sansa to inform her that her father has been arrested for treason. They manipulate Sansa into writing a letter to her brother Robb, asking him to bend the knee peacefully to Joffrey. They add that Eddard's fate may depend on what his son and the other <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> lords do. Sansa agrees to write the letter. 
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> on, King Joffrey holds court in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>. <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade>, commander of the <entidade:<entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> Watch><entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> Watch</entidade>, is to be made Lord of <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> as a reward for his loyal service. Cersei then dismisses Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> as head of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, noting that the time has come for an honorable retirement. Selmy is confused, pointing out that <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> serve for life, but Joffrey angrily says that Selmy is too old, and couldn't protect his father. Selmy's disgrace is only compounded when he learns his post as Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> is to be given to <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>, much to his disgust. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> announces that Selmy is to be given a castle and land in recognition of his years of service, but the old knight, insulted by what he sees as being offered "a hall to die in and men to bury me," takes off his armor, throws his sword at Joffrey's feet and storms out, stating that he could still kill all five of the other <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> present with ease.
Sansa begs Joffrey for her father's life, claiming that the medicine he was taking for his injured leg was responsible for his treasonous talk. Joffrey says that her sweet words have moved him and he will spare Eddard, if he bends the knee to him and acknowledges him as king. Sansa says he will.
