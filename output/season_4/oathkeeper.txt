Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daenerys has 163 of the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Masters crucified.  
<entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> teaches <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> how to speak the <entidade:Common <entidade:Common Tongue>Tongue</entidade>>Common <entidade:Common Tongue>Tongue</entidade></entidade>, where he reveals that all he remembers since his castration is that he was born in the <entidade:<entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> Isles><entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> Isles</entidade>. <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> also reveals that she can remember that she saw <entidade:Naath>Naath</entidade> burning, as she was tacken as a slave for Slaver's Bay. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> commands him and several <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> to infiltrate Meereen disguised as slaves and convince the slaves to rise against their masters. They visit a slave pen, where a number of slaves are discussing whether or not to rise against the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Masters. One of the young slaves is already trying to convince his fellow men in chains to fight, but the older slaves argue they have no means to oppose their Masters, who have squashed every previous slave rebellion. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> arrives and tells them that only they can free themselves, then presents them with weapons. The uprising is a resounding success. With the city hers, <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> orders the crucifixion of 163 of the so-called "<entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Masters" in retaliation for the 163 slave children crucified on the road to Meereen. Ser Barristan advises her against it, saying that sometimes it is best to answer injustice with mercy. Daenerys shows her <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> blood by firmly declaring that she will "answer injustice with justice." The cries of the crucified <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Masters reach <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>'s ears atop Meereen's tallest pyramid, where the city's emblem, the golden harpy of Ghis, has been draped in the banner of House <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>. Now, she has conquered all three of the cities on Slaver's Bay.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> and <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> are teaching several recruits, including <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> and <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade>, how to fight against wildlings. <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> admonishes Jon and reminds him that he is a steward, not a ranger, trying to provoke Jon in an excuse to have him killed. Jon leaves the yard and talks with <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade>, who pretends he is from the <entidade:Stormlands>Stormlands</entidade> and genuinely wants to protect the realm. <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade> points out to Thorne that Jon is well liked and Thorne is not, and when <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> insists upon an election for a new Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade>, Jon is far more likely to succeed Mormont. Slynt convinces Thorne to allow Jon to deal with the mutineers, in the hope that they will remove him from the problem. Meanwhile, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> is fretting about <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade>'s safety in Mole's <entidade:Town>Town</entidade> with the wildlings loose, and it is revealed that Sam told Jon about Bran still being alive and north of the wall. <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> brings Jon to Thorne, who sanctions his mission but tells Jon that he must secure volunteers rather than have men ordered along with him. Jon gives an impassioned speech, insisting that not only must the mutineers be dealt with for <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>'s safety, but Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> Mormont deserves justice. Much to Thorne and Slynt's surprise, <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade>, <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison Tollett</entidade> and a group of other men join Jon on his mission, including <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> who asks to say his vows if that is required before he goes north of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
During their sword training, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> implores Jaime to visit his brother Tyrion in the dungeon, saying that Tyrion named Jaime his champion in The <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade> because he knew Jaime would ride day and night to fight for him. Jaime finally visits Tyrion, confessing that Cersei asked him to murder him. Convincing Jaime that he didn't kill Joffrey, Tyrion notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy Cersei. She is out for Tyrion's blood, and he says that the trial is even worse because at least one judge has always wanted him dead. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei offers a knighthood to whomever captures <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>. Tyrion insists that Sansa had nothing to do with the murder, despite having the best motive. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, Jaime visits Cersei, who is disgusted that, in her view, Jaime is taking Tyrion's side because of his long-held affection for their brother.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> Olenna tells Margaery that she is about to leave for <entidade:Highgarden>Highgarden</entidade>. She mentions the new and prospective marriage between Margaery and the new king, <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>. She insists that Cersei will turn <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> against Margaery by the time they marry if Margaery doesn't act fast. Fortunately, Cersei is well distracted by accusing her innocent brother of the murder of her son. Margaery insists that Olenna cannot be certain of Tyrion's innocence, but Olenna states that Tyrion certainly is innocent and confesses that she would never have let Margaery marry "that beast." Margaery is shocked but her grandmother firmly ends the conversation. That night, Margaery enters <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>'s chambers, slipping past the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> and charming <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>. She puts in his mind the idea that one day she will be his and they might as well learn to like each other, and compliments him on his cat and kind demeanour. She promises to visit again and <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> falls asleep smiling.
In the chambers of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, Jaime tasks <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> with finding Sansa.  He urges her to find and keep the girl safe from those who would hand her over to Cersei and provides her with a horse, supplies, and a freshly forged suit of armor. Jaime then gifts her with the sword his father gave him, saying that the Valyrian steel is forged from <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned Stark</entidade>'s sword and that the steel from <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned Stark</entidade>'s sword should be used to defend <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned Stark</entidade>'s daughters. He also insists she take <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> with her as a squire, both as a reward for the boy's service to Tyrion and to keep him safe from those who would seek to use him against his former master. Before departing, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> names the sword "<entidade:Oathkeeper>Oathkeeper</entidade>" and vows to find Sansa, for the sake of Jaime and <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> Catelyn.

<entidade:En>En</entidade> route to the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>
Sansa accuses <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> of having <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade> murdered. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> first Baelish evades the accusation, pointing out that he has been away for weeks and that Tyrion could be the perpetrator. Sansa defends Tyrion, with an innate certainty that he is innocent, and mentions that Baelish is far too smart to trust a drunk with the scheme. Impressed with her instincts, Baelish admits that Tyrion is in fact innocent, and reveals Sansa's own part in Joffrey's death - Ser <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade>' necklace was in fact the murder weapon, and someone slipped a stone (which was poisonous) into Joffrey's wine. Sansa is bewildered, because the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> have done so much for Baelish, including granting him the seat of <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>. Baelish confesses that while his friendship with the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> was fruitful, it is best to keep enemies confused and his absence from the wedding means that he will never be suspected. Sansa declares that she doesn't entirely believe him: he's too clever to poison a king just to cause confusion. Baelish is again impressed, and confirms that Joffrey was simply too volatile; a king like him as an ally was more a hindrance than a benefit. More importantly, though, Joffrey's death was something that his "new friends" wanted very much, and a gift is always helpful to help a new friendship "grow strong."

<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep, the mutinous deserters are still entrenched there, indulging themselves on the food stored there and raping <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s wives. <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> drinks wine from the skull of <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor Mormont</entidade>, drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> before ordering <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> to "feed the beast." <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the same time, one of <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s wives enters with <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s last son, insisting the infant must be given as a 'gift to the gods.. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade>'s orders, <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> leaves the infant on a patch of open ground, then deals with the beast - <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade>, who the mutineers have caged, and whom <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> taunts by withholding food and water from the direwolf. Suddenly, a snowstorm whips up and the temperature drops, causing the water <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> was taunting <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> with to freeze. Recognizing the approach of <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> flees.
Nearby, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran Stark</entidade> and his companions hear the child's cries; warging into <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>, Bran goes to investigate, but <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> falls into a trap just outside <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep. <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera Reed</entidade>, sensing danger, urges them to move on, but Bran insists on trying to free <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> and <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>; before they can, however, they are taken prisoner by the mutineers. Some of the deserters amuse themselves by tormenting <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>, while the others are taken to <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade>, who threatens to kill Meera and Jojen. Jojen is suddenly overcome by a seizure and falls to the floor while Meera begs to be let go so she can help him. <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> does so when Bran reveals his true identity.

In the Lands of Always <entidade:Winter>Winter</entidade>
Somewhere in the northernmost reaches of the world, a lone <entidade:White Walker>White Walker</entidade> rides its undead horse towards a shattered mountain, cradling <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s last son in its arm. When it reaches the mountain, the <entidade:White Walker>White Walker</entidade> places the baby upon an altar of ice at the center of a ring of large icicles. On the other side, a line of dark-garbed <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> watch the proceedings. After a moment, one of them strides forth and carefully picks up the wailing child, who swiftly calms. The <entidade:White Walker>White Walker</entidade> presses the nail of its index finger into the baby's cheek. The sound of cracking ice can be heard as the child's eyes turn a depthless, icy blue.
