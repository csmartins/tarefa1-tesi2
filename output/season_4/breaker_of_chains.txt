Summary
At <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
With <entidade:King Joffrey>King Joffrey</entidade> dead, Cersei mourns the death of her elder son with the heir apparent and, still holding Joffrey in her arms, demands that <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> be found. Her father seals the capital, so no one can leave. Prince <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen Baratheon</entidade>, in the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>. <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, also present, immediately begins instructing the young prince on the qualities of a good king. As <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> and Tommen leave, Jaime enters to see Cersei calling for the death of the accused <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and his wife, <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>. Jaime sends the septon and septas away so he can be alone with Cersei. He tries to comfort her through his affections. She refuses initially, but Jaime is aggressive. Cersei insists that the sept during a private viewing of their son's corpse is a highly inappropriate place for sex, and asks Jaime to stop, saying "It isn't right, it isn't right..." and Jaime refuses to stop, saying, "I don't care, I don't care...". They then have sex next to their dead son's corpse.
A flashback to the wedding reveals Sansa escaping with Ser <entidade:Dontos Hollard>Dontos Hollard</entidade> from <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> to a ship off the coast. As Sansa is taken aboard, she is greeted by <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade></entidade> "<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>" Baelish. He remembers that he still owes Dontos his fee, but Baelish has two men kill him with crossbows. He explains to Sansa that <entidade:Ser Dontos>Ser Dontos</entidade> was a drunken fool and an unreliable ally who only helped Sansa for money and would turn her in for money. To prove his point, he shows that the priceless necklace Dontos gave her was actually made a few weeks ago on Baelish's orders. Sansa is confused and horrified, but Baelish promises to keep her safe.
<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> interrupts <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn Martell</entidade> and his group sex act with <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade> and <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> to discuss <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s up-coming trial for the murder of Joffrey. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> brings up Oberyn's knowledge of poisons and the link between that and Joffrey's death – as some say the King was poisoned – and wonders whether Oberyn had helped <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>. The topic changes to the murder of Oberyn's sister <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> by <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>'s "pet," the <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade>, during the <entidade:Sack>Sack</entidade> of <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> denies ordering her death, but promises to arrange a meeting between Oberyn and the <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade> so he can have his justice. He also offers Oberyn a position on the Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade>, if Oberyn agrees to be the third judge at <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s trial. He explains that he is eager to bring <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> back into the fold, wanting to unite the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> against more obvious threats; the <entidade:Greyjoys>Greyjoys</entidade> are in rebellion, a <entidade:Wildling>Wildling</entidade> army is advancing on the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, and there is a Targaryen girl in the <entidade:Eastern Road>East</entidade> with a powerful army and three dragons, who will eventually threaten <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> observes that only the <entidade:Dornish>Dornish</entidade> successfully resisted <entidade:<entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> Targaryen><entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> Targaryen</entidade>'s dragons during his invasion of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> three centuries ago; Oberyn dryly notes it must be hard for <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> to admit he needs the <entidade:Dornish>Dornish</entidade> for help.
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is in a cell in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. He is visited by his squire, <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade>, who has smuggled in some food and other items for him. Pod has been asked to compile a list of <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s witnesses. He names his wife, Sansa, but Pod informs him that she disappeared moments after Joffrey's death. He cannot speak to <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> either because, as a close associate of <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, he is also under investigation. Pod confirms that there has been no word of <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, which <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> takes as good news. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> then asks to speak with Jaime. He also warns Pod to be aware of his surroundings and watch out for "They," "They" being the spies of <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>, Cersei, <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> or more or less anyone else. He opines that many people had a motive for killing Joffrey. Cersei is the only person he rules out. He urges Pod to get out of <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> as he would be in much danger due to his close relations with <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, especially after refusing to testify against <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, despite the offer of a knighthood. As Pod is about to leave, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> calls him back and tells him that "there has never lived a more loyal squire."

In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>
Meanwhile, <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> and the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>, crossing the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, are spotted by a farmer and his young daughter while making their way to the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> where <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> can be ransomed to her "rich" aunt, <entidade:Lysa <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade>>Lysa <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade></entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> quickly fabricates a story that the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> and she are father and daughter, with Clegane as a knight in service of <entidade:House <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade>>House <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade></entidade>. The farmer believes it and allows the pair to stay the night in his home and share a meal. <entidade:Famished>Famished</entidade>, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> scarf the food down hastily. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> wakes the following morning to hear the farmer's daughter screaming. Clegane has assaulted the farmer and taken his silver. Confused and horrified, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> demands to know why Clegane did that. He simply states, "a dead man doesn't need his silver," claiming the farmer is weak and he and his daughter will not survive the upcoming winter.

At <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> fears for the safety of <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and moves her to a vassal town that frequently services the <entidade:Nights <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>>Nights <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade></entidade> brothers in bodily vices. Sam is resolute in keeping <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> safe from all harm however and pledges to visit <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> as much as possible, instructing the inn at which he leaves her, that she will not be touched. Meanwhile, a village south of the wall is attacked by raiding wildlings under <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> and the cannibalistic <entidade:Thenns>Thenns</entidade>. While the village is massacred, a lone boy is sent by the <entidade:Styr>Styr</entidade> as a messenger to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> to relay an account of the massacre and also a warning that more would follow. The <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> states that they do not have the manpower to afford venturing away from the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. They are interrupted when two rangers, Edd and <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade>, arrive back at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> after escaping <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep. Jon reveals he told <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade> that a thousand men armed <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> and therefore points out that when Mance reaches <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep, <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> and <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> will not hesitate in revealing the truth. Jon then insists the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> send a party to <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep to kill their traitor brothers before Mance gets to them first.

As Naharis quickly dispatches the <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> champion, <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> begins her siege of the city by speaking of freedom to the gathered slaves and then catapulting the broken chains of those she has freed across the city walls, demonstrating her previous successes.
