With King Joffrey dead, Cersei mourns the death of her elder son with the heir apparent and, still holding Joffrey in her arms, demands that <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> be found. Her father seals the capital, so no one can leave. <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>, in the <entidade:<entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>. <entidade:<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, also present, immediately begins instructing the young prince on the qualities of a good king. As <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> and <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> leave, Jaime enters to see Cersei calling for the death of the accused <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and his wife, <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>. Jaime sends the septon and septas away so he can be alone with Cersei. He tries to comfort her through his affections. She refuses initially, but Jaime is aggressive. Cersei insists that the sept during a private viewing of their son's corpse is a highly inappropriate place for sex, and asks Jaime to stop, saying "It isn't right, it isn't right..." and Jaime refuses to stop, saying, "I don't care, I don't care...". They then have sex next to their dead son's corpse.
A flashback to the wedding reveals Sansa escaping with Ser <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> <entidade:Hollard>Hollard</entidade> from King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> to a ship off the coast. As Sansa is taken aboard, she is greeted by Lord Petyr "<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>" Baelish. He remembers that he still owes <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> his fee, but Baelish has two men kill him with crossbows. He explains to Sansa that Ser <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> was a drunken fool and an unreliable ally who only helped Sansa for money and would turn her in for money. To prove his point, he shows that the priceless necklace <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> gave her was actually made a few weeks ago on Baelish's orders. Sansa is confused and horrified, but Baelish promises to keep her safe.
<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> interrupts <entidade:<entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> Martell><entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> Martell</entidade> and his group sex act with <entidade:<entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> Sand><entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> Sand</entidade> and Olyvar to discuss <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s up-coming trial for the murder of Joffrey. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> brings up <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>'s knowledge of poisons and the link between that and Joffrey's death – as some say the King was poisoned – and wonders whether <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> had helped <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. The topic changes to the murder of <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>'s sister Elia by <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>'s "pet," the <entidade:Mountain That Rides>Mountain</entidade>, during the <entidade:Sack>Sack</entidade> of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> denies ordering her death, but promises to arrange a meeting between <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> and the <entidade:Mountain That Rides>Mountain</entidade> so he can have his justice. He also offers <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> a position on the <entidade:Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade>>Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade></entidade>, if <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> agrees to be the third judge at <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s trial. He explains that he is eager to bring <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> back into the fold, wanting to unite the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> against more obvious threats; the <entidade:Greyjoys>Greyjoys</entidade> are in rebellion, a <entidade:Wildlings>Wildling</entidade> army is advancing on the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, and there is a <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> girl in the <entidade:Eastern Road>East</entidade> with a powerful army and three dragons, who will eventually threaten <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> observes that only the Dornish successfully resisted <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>'s dragons during his invasion of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> three centuries ago; <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> dryly notes it must be hard for <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> to admit he needs the Dornish for help.
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is in a cell in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. He is visited by his squire, <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade>, who has smuggled in some food and other items for him. Pod has been asked to compile a list of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s witnesses. He names his wife, Sansa, but Pod informs him that she disappeared moments after Joffrey's death. He cannot speak to <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> either because, as a close associate of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, he is also under investigation. Pod confirms that there has been no word of <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, which <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> takes as good news. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> then asks to speak with Jaime. He also warns Pod to be aware of his surroundings and watch out for "They," "They" being the spies of <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>, Cersei, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> or more or less anyone else. He opines that many people had a motive for killing Joffrey. Cersei is the only person he rules out. He urges Pod to get out of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> as he would be in much danger due to his close relations with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, especially after refusing to testify against <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, despite the offer of a knighthood. As Pod is about to leave, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> calls him back and tells him that "there has never lived a more loyal squire."

In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>
Meanwhile, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade> and the Hound, crossing the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, are spotted by a farmer and his young daughter while making their way to the Vale where Arya can be ransomed to her "rich" aunt, <entidade:Lysa Tully>Lysa Tully</entidade>. Arya quickly fabricates a story that the Hound and she are father and daughter, with Clegane as a knight in service of House Tully. The farmer believes it and allows the pair to stay the night in his home and share a meal. Famished, Arya and the Hound scarf the food down hastily. Arya wakes the following morning to hear the farmer's daughter screaming. Clegane has assaulted the farmer and taken his silver. Confused and horrified, Arya demands to know why Clegane did that. He simply states, "a dead man doesn't need his silver," claiming the farmer is weak and he and his daughter will not survive the upcoming winter.

Shortly after, when Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> begins his reading lessons with princess <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen Baratheon</entidade>, he realizes a possible ally across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>, the <entidade:Iron Bank>Iron Bank</entidade> of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>.

Sam is resolute in keeping <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> safe from all harm however and pledges to visit <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> as much as possible, instructing the inn at which he leaves her, that she will not be touched. Meanwhile, a village south of the wall is attacked by raiding wildlings under Tormund and the cannibalistic Thenns. While the village is massacred, a lone boy is sent by the <entidade:Styr>Styr</entidade> as a messenger to <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade> to relay an account of the massacre and also a warning that more would follow. The Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> states that they do not have the manpower to afford venturing away from the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>. They are interrupted when two rangers, Edd and <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade>, arrive back at <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade> after escaping Craster's <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>. Jon reveals he told <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade> that a thousand men armed <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade> and therefore points out that when Mance reaches Craster's <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> and <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> will not hesitate in revealing the truth. Jon then insists the Night's Watch send a party to Craster's <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade> to kill their traitor brothers before Mance gets to them first.

​Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
In Slaver's Bay, Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> marches on the city of Meereen as she begins her siege of the slave city. She is faced with a champion's duel where a riding knight of Meereen challenges her to choose a champion that will fight for her. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>, Jorah and Barristan all volunteer to stand as her champion; she refuses all three as too valuable to her. <entidade:<entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> Naharis><entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> Naharis</entidade>, commander of the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>, then volunteers to be <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>'s champion, and she accepts. As Naharis quickly dispatches the Meereen champion, <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> begins her siege of the city by speaking of freedom to the gathered slaves and then catapulting the broken chains of those she has freed across the city walls, demonstrating her previous successes. As the slaves examine the broken chains, the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Masters look on, perhaps in fear.
