<entidade:Summary>Summary</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>
<entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara Greyjoy</entidade> prepares her troops for their assault on the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade> to rescue her brother, Theon. She reads the letter sent by <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay Snow</entidade>, threatening to flay all ironborn who do not leave the North. While Ramsay has rather violent sex with <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>, Yara and her troops land and scale the walls of the castle. They quietly take out the guards as they search for Theon. Interrogating a guard, Yara learns of Theon's location which is the dog kennels, and Yara then kills the guard, despite promising not to. There, the ironborn and Yara see Theon sitting in a cage. Yara opens the cage, but Theon refuses to go with her, believing it is another cruel trick played by Ramsay. Ramsay and several <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> troops enter and a fight ensues, with several <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> and Greyjoy soldiers killed. Theon tells Yara his name has always been <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, bites her, and cowers in his cage. Ramsay releases the hounds and Yara is forced to retreat to her ship. When one of the ironmen asks about Theon, Yara says Theon is "dead." 
Ramsay allows <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to take a bath, as a reward for his loyalty. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> fears the bath is another trick but Ramsay assures him it is not. While <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> bathes, Ramsay now plans to assault <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade> and needs <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to pretend to be someone he isn't: Theon Greyjoy.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> a meeting of the <entidade:Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade>>Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> informs the councilors that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s trial will begin that afternoon. Lord <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> informs <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> that the Hound has been spotted in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> orders a bounty on his head. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> also informs the council of Daenerys's conquest of Meereen, and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> decides to take measures to prevent her from launching an invasion. In the dungeon, Jaime has <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> shackled and brought into the throne room to begin his trial. King <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> recuses himself from the trial, appointing his grandfather <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>, <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Oberyn Martell><entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> Martell</entidade>, and Lord <entidade:Mace Tyrell><entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> Tyrell</entidade> as judges. Several witnesses are called for the prosecution, including Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade>, Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade>, Queen <entidade:Regent>Regent</entidade> Cersei, and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, all of whom give testimony backing the accusations against <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>.

    <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> testifies at <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s trial  
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> recess, Jaime asks <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> to spare <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, offering to break his oath to the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> and return to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>, to be his heir. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> accepts, telling Jaime that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> will be allowed to join the Night's Watch after being found guilty of Joffrey's murder, provided he pleads for mercy. Before the recess ends, Jaime speaks with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and urges him to do so. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is deeply distrustful of the offer, remarking that <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade> was promised the same thing and yet still lost his head, but Jaime pleads with his brother to trust him, insisting that their father will keep his word.
Returning to the trial, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> orders the next witness to testify: <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>. She testifies that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and Sansa planned Joffrey's murder together, claiming that Sansa wanted vengeance for the murder of her father, mother, and brother. She tells the judges of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s sexual desires, embarrassing him in front of the crowd. Before she can continue, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, enraged beyond sense, angrily demands that he be allowed to confess his crimes. He angrily roars about how he saved King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> from <entidade:Stannis Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>'s forces and says he should've allowed <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> to kill everyone in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, much to the horror and disgust of the people in the court. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> then claims to be guilty. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> assumes that he is guilty for murdering King <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> denies this, saying he is guilty of a "far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf!" <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> scoffs at <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s claims and says he is not on trial for being a dwarf. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> angrily says he has been on trial for his entire life as a dwarf. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> asks if he has nothing to say in his defense. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> then says he has nothing to say in his defense "but only this." He then reveals his true feelings about Joffrey, denying guilt in the king's murder but saying he wished to have killed Joffrey himself. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> then turns his full fury towards Cersei and says that watching her "vicious bastard" of a son die gave him more relief than "a thousand lying whores." He then turns around to the court and roars that he wishes to have become the monster they thought he was and would have gladly give his life to watch everyone die from drinking poison. <entidade:This>This</entidade> enrages everyone in the court and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> orders Ser Meryn to escort <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> back to the dungeons. Before he can be escorted out, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> bellows that he will not lose his life for a crime he did not commit and, knowing that he will get no justice from the court, demands a trial by combat. 

In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>
<entidade:Stannis Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> visit the <entidade:Iron Bank>Iron Bank</entidade> of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> in hopes of securing funds to aid <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>' war effort. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> first <entidade:Tycho Nestoris><entidade:Tycho Nestoris>Tycho</entidade> Nestoris</entidade>, a representative from the bank, rejects their request, but <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> entreats him and points out that funding <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is the best way they could possibly get the gold they loaned to <entidade:Tywin Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> back. The Bank agrees to lend them gold, and <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> uses it to once again recruit his old pirate friend <entidade:Salladhor Saan><entidade:Salladhor Saan>Salladhor</entidade> Saan</entidade> to <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>' cause.

In Meereen
    <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> toasting goats  <entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> one sunny day outside of Meereen, a goat herder and his son are peacefully tending the goats on a hill while the son throws rocks to pass the time. Suddenly, <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> (now the size of a horse) appears and burns the field and kills a flock of goats while taking one with him. The goat herder travels to Meereen to visit the queen and lays the charred remains of his flock before Daenerys, hoping to not anger the queen and believes it to be punishment. Daenerys apologizes about <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade>'s actions and promises to pay back three times the worth of his flock. 
After he departs, <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade> presents his petition: the right to bury his father's remains in the <entidade:Temple>Temple</entidade> of the <entidade:Grace>Graces</entidade>, as he was one of the Meereenese <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Masters crucified on Daenerys's orders. She counters that he was one of the masters that crucified the 163 children. <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade> reveals that his father actually spoke out against the crucifixion of the slave children but was overruled, but later was killed due to Daenerys's judgment anyway. Somewhat mollified, Daenerys allows him to bury his father. As he leaves, Daenerys asks how many more supplicants are waiting; <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> answers that there are over 200 more.
