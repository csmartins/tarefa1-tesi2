Plot
A who's who of honored guests turns out for Joffrey and Margaery's wedding in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. Meanwhile, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> gives a lesson to an unlikely pupil; <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s vision helps map out his journey; <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> loses patience with Davos; and Ramsay takes a perverse delight in his new pet.

Summary
At <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>
On the beach of <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> presides over a public burning ceremony, setting three people chained to stakes ablaze as an offering to the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade>. <entidade:One>One</entidade> of the condemned is <entidade:Queen <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade>>Queen <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade></entidade> Baratheon's own brother <entidade:Axell Florent>Axell Florent</entidade>, condemned for his lack of faith in the Lord's power. Watching the proceedings, Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> holds his tongue, though his disgust both for the ritual and <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> are plain. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is surprisingly silent throughout the proceedings; it is <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> who takes the greatest pleasure in the ritual.
Afterwards, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> eat dinner, with <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> as a guest at their table. The royal couple argue over their daughter, Princess <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen Baratheon</entidade>; <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> believes the girl's disfigurement is a punishment from the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade>, but <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> angrily forbids his wife from trying to physically chastise their daughter for her perceived faults. <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> switches tactics and suggests that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> speak to Shireen. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> doesn't protest, but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> doesn't look particularly interested in the task. Nonetheless, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> does speak with Shireen, who heard the death of her uncle from her bedroom window, explaining in gentle yet matter-of-fact terms that the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> of the Seven and its holy books are lies: <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> insists there are only two gods, the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> and the Great Other, constantly at war. When Shireen asks if there is any truth to the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade>'s belief in seven heavens and seven hells, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> replies "There is only one hell... the one we live in now".

At the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>
In the forests surrounding the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>, the seat of House <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, <entidade:Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> hunts a peasant girl for his sport, accompanied by <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> (whom Ramsay now addresses by his new name, <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>) and <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>, along with a pack of savage dogs. The girl is eventually brought down and torn to pieces by the dogs, much to <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>'s horror.
Soon after, Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> arrives at the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade> accompanied by a detachment of his army, including <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> and Roose's new wife, <entidade:Walda Bolton>Walda</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>. Ramsay greets his father and his new step-mother (as well as privately congratulating <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> for his maiming of the <entidade:Kingslayer>Kingslayer</entidade>). Roose wants to see Ramsay's captive <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>.
Theon is brought to Roose's chambers, where Roose is disgusted and angered to learn Ramsay has tortured and flayed Theon; as <entidade:Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>'s sole surviving male heir, Theon was a valuable hostage. Roose notes that while he has been named <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn, and he had intended on trading Theon for <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade>, a strategically placed fortress on the border between the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> and the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> currently held by <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> forces, preventing the main <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> army from returning north. Ramsay retorts that he already sent terms and Balon refused him. Roose is furious that Ramsay did so without his consent, but Ramsay demonstrates that his actions have made <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> docile and unable to betray them.
After ordering <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to shave him, Ramsay cajoles him into admitting that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark><entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> Stark</entidade> are still alive. Ramsay reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade>'s rule of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> following <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s death, and nearly all the <entidade:Northerners>Northerners</entidade>, who are furious at House <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> and <entidade:House Frey>House Frey</entidade>'s treachery against the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>, will rally behind <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>Â rather than Roose if they learn the boys are alive. Ramsay, knowing how close Theon was to Robb, gleefully taunts him by revealing details of the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade>, particularly relishing the fact that it was Roose who personally murdered Robb. Despite being clearly shaken to know the man he considered a brother is dead at the hands of his new masters, Theon does not openly react.
Roose dispatches <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> with orders to find and kill <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>; <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> suggests that <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> might either be sheltering the boys at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> or at least may know where they have gone, while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well, given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat, since the <entidade:Northeners>Northeners</entidade> will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge (although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> and thus legally untouchable by the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>). Roose gives Ramsay orders as well; to take Theon and an army to <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade> and reclaim the fortress from the <entidade:Greyjoys>Greyjoys</entidade>. If he succeeds, Roose will give consideration to legitimizing Ramsay as a member of House <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>.

<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
We follow the point of view of a panting figure traveling through a dark, snow-covered forest. It kills a deer. Just as the figure makes its kill, it is revealed that the figure is <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> and that <entidade:<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> had been warging into <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s warging is interrupted by Meera <entidade:House Reed>Reed</entidade>, who says that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> had been gone for hours. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> is not happy about having been snapped out of his warging, saying that he was eating. <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> <entidade:House Reed>Reed</entidade> clarifies that <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> was eating and that what <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> cannot gain sustenance from what <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> eats. <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> and Meera also caution <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> that warging so long is dangerous for other reasons. Even though it allows <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> the mobility he lost when he was injured, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> would become trapped, forgetting his friends, his family, his home, and even himself. And if <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> forgets himself, they all lose everything.
The group breaks camp and continues traveling through the forest. They eventually come upon a weirwood tree. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has Hodor take him to the tree. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> touches the tree just under the face carved into it and sees a vision. Several images rush to <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s mind, including swarms of crows, wights (both human and horses), and the fall that paralyzed him. He also sees the <entidade:Three-eyed Raven>Three-eyed</entidade> raven taking flight in a darkened corridor and later land on a tree. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> sees his father sharpening <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade>, in the <entidade:Black Cells>Black Cells</entidade>, and being led to his execution; the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> abandoned and covered in snow; and the shadow of a dragon flying over <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> also sees several images of a different weirwood tree located on top of an otherwise barren mountain. During the vision, a gravely voice tells <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> to "look for me beneath the tree... <entidade:NORTH>NORTH</entidade>." <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> snaps out of his vision out of breath, but then matter-of-factly states, "I know where we have to go."

At <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
Over a meal, Jaime and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> discuss Jaime's gilded steel hand, and he discloses to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he can no longer fight, as all of his instincts are wrong using his left hand. Jaime is perturbed that people will find out that he cannot fight so <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> tells him that he needs to train with his left hand with someone trustworthy in order to better protect the king, as the <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>.

    <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> presented before <entidade:King Joffrey>King Joffrey</entidade> and <entidade:Queen Margaery>Queen Margaery</entidade> at their wedding.  
Later, Jaime waits in a courtyard by the sea for his training partner that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> has arranged. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> emerges with two training swords. Jaime remarks that he hasn't wielded a sparring sword since he was nine. As they commence training, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> uses his usual dirty tactics and gets the better of Jaime, teaching him not only to use his offhand, but encouraging him to fight dirtier.
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> finds <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> on his way to a breakfast celebration on the day of Joffrey's wedding. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> divulges that <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> has been spotted and that his sister, Cersei, has been notified. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> then says that there is nothing he can do to protect <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> any longer in fear of <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King, or Cersei finding out that he has been lying to them. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> then says that <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> will not leave <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> and is warned that <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> has threatened to hang the next whore <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is seen with.

    The dais set up for the royal wedding.  
At the breakfast celebration, <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace Tyrell</entidade> gifts Joffrey a magnificent golden chalice with seven facets, one for each of the major houses in the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> and wishes he and his daughter, <entidade:Margaery Tyrell>Margaery Tyrell</entidade>, a long and happy marriage. Joffrey graciously accepts. Cersei spots <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> and tells <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> that she is <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s whore, and he commands for her to be sent to the Tower of the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> before the wedding. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> overhears this and looks vexed, but proceeds to approach Joffrey and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade>, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s squire, presents him with the Lives of <entidade:Four Kings>Four Kings</entidade>, a book detailing the reigns of four kings by <entidade:Grand Maester Kaeth>Grand Maester Kaeth</entidade>. Joffrey accepts the gift but his sincerity seems questionable. A member of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> then presents a Valyrian steel sword and <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> tells him that it is one of two swords of its kind in the capital, and Joffrey rushes to wield it. He promptly begins to slash at <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s gift despite its rarity, and then asks for suggestions on its name from guests in attendance. He settle on the name Widow's Wail.
After the breakfast, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is visited in his chambers by <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> and he informs her that there is a ship waiting for her bound for <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> and that their "friendship" is at an end. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> pleads to stay, but <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> says he is married and it is too dangerous for her to stay. 

    Joffrey is poisoned and killed.  
When <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> enters and tries to escort her out, she slaps him and runs away. When <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> later asks <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> if she is gone, he says that she boarded the ship. When <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> asks if he saw it sail away, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her, that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>. He then advises <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to go and drink until it feels like he did the right thing.
Joffrey and Margaery's wedding ceremony takes place in the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>Â conducted by the <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> and they are wed in front of gods and men. At his wedding feast, <entidade:King Joffrey>King Joffrey</entidade> speaks to the crowd about contemplating history. Out of a large golden lion, five dwarves ride out, representing Joffrey, <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly Baratheon</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon, <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>, and <entidade:Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>, each of the five kings in the <entidade:War>War</entidade> of the <entidade:Five Kings>Five Kings</entidade>. The dwarves put on a performance, jousting, fighting, and making crude sexual acts. Joffrey, his brother Tommen, andÂ CerseiÂ laugh at the performance. The <entidade:Tyrells>Tyrells</entidade> (Margaery, Olenna, Mace, and Loras), as well as <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>, <entidade:Prince Oberyn>Prince Oberyn</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>,Â <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>,Â and <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, make little effort to hide their disgust. Loras leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover Renly (riding a mount resembling Loras), and Sansa looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother Robb is killed after having his wolf's head knocked off. Joffrey expresses his delight with the play and prepares to give the champion dwarf a purse but then mockingly suggests that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> fight him as well. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that Joffrey should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>, cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is "clearly mad with lust" and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night. This draws a few stifled chuckles from their guests. <entidade:Enraged>Enraged</entidade> and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his wedding guests, Joffrey petulantly pours wine over <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s head and orders him to serve him wine as his cupbearer.
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> approaches Joffrey, who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table. Sansa hands the goblet to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, and he fills it with wine and hands it back to Joffrey. The king demands that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> kneel before him but <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> refuses. Margaery interrupts the tense moment and says it is time to cut the pigeon pie. Joffrey hands the goblet to Margaery, who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother Olenna. Joffrey draws his new sword, cuts the pie, and several white doves fly out.

    Cersei cries over her sons murder.  
Sansa and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> attempt to leave the feast, while Margaery serves Joffrey a piece of pie. Joffrey commands <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to serve him wine to wash down the pie. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> hands the goblet to Joffrey and he quickly drinks all of it. Joffrey tries to speak, but begins coughing. He grabs his throat, and Margaery and Olenna exclaim that he is choking and needs help. Joffrey collapses face down and begins vomiting and convulsing. Jaime and Cersei rush in and turn Joffrey over on his back. <entidade:Dontos Hollard>Dontos Hollard</entidade> suddenly approaches Sansa from behind and says she must come with him quickly, and she does. Joffrey points an accusatory finger in <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s direction, as he examines the wine goblet (though it is not made clear if Joffrey is accusing <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> or merely the wine). Joffrey's eyes turn red, blood runs from his nose, he stops convulsing, and dies. Cersei sobs with grief and orders the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> to seize <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> for the poisoning of her son.
