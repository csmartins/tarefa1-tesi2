Plot
A who's who of honored guests turns out for <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and Margaery's wedding in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. Meanwhile, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> gives a lesson to an unlikely pupil; Bran's vision helps map out his journey; <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> loses patience with Davos; and <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> takes a perverse delight in his new pet.

Summary
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:House Baratheon Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> the beach of <entidade:House Baratheon Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> presides over a public burning ceremony, setting three people chained to stakes ablaze as an offering to the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. One of the condemned is <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> Baratheon's own brother <entidade:Axell Florent>Axell Florent</entidade>, condemned for his lack of faith in the Lord's power. Watching the proceedings, Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> holds his tongue, though his disgust both for the ritual and <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> are plain. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is surprisingly silent throughout the proceedings; it is <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> who takes the greatest pleasure in the ritual.
Afterwards, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> eat dinner, with <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> as a guest at their table. The royal couple argue over their daughter, Princess <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> Baratheon; <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> believes the girl's disfigurement is a punishment from the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> angrily forbids his wife from trying to physically chastise their daughter for her perceived faults. <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> switches tactics and suggests that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> speak to <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> doesn't protest, but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> doesn't look particularly interested in the task. Nonetheless, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> does speak with <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>, who heard the death of her uncle from her bedroom window, explaining in gentle yet matter-of-fact terms that the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven</entidade> and its holy books are lies: <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> insists there are only two gods, the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> and the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> Other, constantly at war. When <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> asks if there is any truth to the Faith's belief in seven heavens and seven hells, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> replies "There is only one hell... the one we live in now".

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the forests surrounding the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>, the seat of <entidade:House Bolton>House Bolton</entidade>, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay Snow</entidade> hunts a peasant girl for his sport, accompanied by Theon <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> (whom <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> now addresses by his new name, Reek) and <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>, along with a pack of savage dogs. The girl is eventually brought down and torn to pieces by the dogs, much to Reek's horror.
Soon after, <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> arrives at the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade> accompanied by a detachment of his army, including <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> and Roose's new wife, <entidade:Walda Bolton>Walda</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> greets his father and his new step-mother (as well as privately congratulating <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> for his maiming of the Kingslayer). <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> wants to see Ramsay's captive Theon <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>.
Theon is brought to Roose's chambers, where <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> is disgusted and angered to learn <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> has tortured and flayed Theon; as <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> Greyjoy's sole surviving male heir, Theon was a valuable hostage. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> notes that while he has been named <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn, and he had intended on trading Theon for <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade>, a strategically placed fortress on the border between the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> and the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> currently held by <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> forces, preventing the main <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> army from returning north. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> retorts that he already sent terms and <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> refused him. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> is furious that <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> did so without his consent, but <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> demonstrates that his actions have made <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> docile and unable to betray them.
After ordering <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to shave him, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> cajoles him into admitting that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> are still alive. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> Stark's rule of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> following <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> Stark's death, and nearly all the <entidade:Northeners>Northerners</entidade>, who are furious at <entidade:House Bolton>House Bolton</entidade> and <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> Frey's treachery against the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>, will rally behind <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and Rickon rather than <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> if they learn the boys are alive. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade>, knowing how close Theon was to <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>, gleefully taunts him by revealing details of the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade>, particularly relishing the fact that it was <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> who personally murdered <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>. Despite being clearly shaken to know the man he considered a brother is dead at the hands of his new masters, Theon does not openly react.
<entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> dispatches <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> with orders to find and kill <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and Rickon; <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> suggests that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> might either be sheltering the boys at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> or at least may know where they have gone, while <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> advocates killing <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> as well, given that the fact he has <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> blood could lead to him becoming a threat, since the <entidade:Northeners>Northeners</entidade> will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge (although harming <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> and thus legally untouchable by the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven</entidade> Kingdoms). <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> gives <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> orders as well; to take Theon and an army to <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade> and reclaim the fortress from the <entidade:Greyjoys>Greyjoys</entidade>. If he succeeds, <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> will give consideration to legitimizing <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> as a member of <entidade:House Bolton>House Bolton</entidade>.

<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
We follow the point of view of a panting figure traveling through a dark, snow-covered forest. It kills a deer. Just as the figure makes its kill, it is revealed that the figure is <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> and that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> had been warging into <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>. Bran's warging is interrupted by <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera Reed</entidade>, who says that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> had been gone for hours. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> is not happy about having been snapped out of his warging, saying that he was eating. <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen Reed</entidade> clarifies that <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> was eating and that what <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> cannot gain sustenance from what <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> eats. <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> and <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> also caution <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> that warging so long is dangerous for other reasons. Even though it allows <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> the mobility he lost when he was injured, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> would become trapped, forgetting his friends, his family, his home, and even himself. And if <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> forgets himself, they all lose everything.
The group breaks camp and continues traveling through the forest. They eventually come upon a weirwood tree. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> take him to the tree. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> touches the tree just under the face carved into it and sees a vision. Several images rush to Bran's mind, including swarms of crows, wights (both human and horses), and the fall that paralyzed him. He also sees the Three-eyed raven taking flight in a darkened corridor and later land on a tree. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> sees his father sharpening <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade>, in the <entidade:Black Cells>Black Cells</entidade>, and being led to his execution; the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> abandoned and covered in snow; and the shadow of a dragon flying over King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> also sees several images of a different weirwood tree located on top of an otherwise barren mountain. During the vision, a gravely voice tells <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> to "look for me beneath the tree... <entidade:NORTH>NORTH</entidade>." <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> snaps out of his vision out of breath, but then matter-of-factly states, "I know where we have to go."

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
Over a meal, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> discuss Jaime's gilded steel hand, and he discloses to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that he can no longer fight, as all of his instincts are wrong using his left hand. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is perturbed that people will find out that he cannot fight so <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> tells him that he needs to train with his left hand with someone trustworthy in order to better protect the king, as the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>.

    <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> presented before <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> at their wedding.  
Later, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> waits in a courtyard by the sea for his training partner that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> has arranged. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> emerges with two training swords. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> remarks that he hasn't wielded a sparring sword since he was nine. As they commence training, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> uses his usual dirty tactics and gets the better of <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, teaching him not only to use his offhand, but encouraging him to fight dirtier.
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> finds <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> on his way to a breakfast celebration on the day of Joffrey's wedding. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> divulges that <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> has been spotted and that his sister, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, has been notified. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> then says that there is nothing he can do to protect <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> any longer in fear of <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade>, the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>, or <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> finding out that he has been lying to them. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> then says that <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> will not leave King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and is warned that <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> has threatened to hang the next whore <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is seen with.

    The dais set up for the royal wedding.  
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the breakfast celebration, <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace Tyrell</entidade> gifts <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> a magnificent golden chalice with seven facets, one for each of the major houses in the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> and wishes he and his daughter, <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade>, a long and happy marriage. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> graciously accepts. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> spots <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> and tells <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> that she is Tyrion's whore, and he commands for her to be sent to the <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade> of the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> before the wedding. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> overhears this and looks vexed, but proceeds to approach <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade>, Tyrion's squire, presents him with the Lives of Four Kings, a book detailing the reigns of four kings by Grand <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> Kaeth. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> accepts the gift but his sincerity seems questionable. A member of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> then presents a <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> steel sword and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> tells him that it is one of two swords of its kind in the capital, and <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> rushes to wield it. He promptly begins to slash at Tyrion's gift despite its rarity, and then asks for suggestions on its name from guests in attendance. He settle on the name Widow's Wail.
After the breakfast, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is visited in his chambers by <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> and he informs her that there is a ship waiting for her bound for <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> and that their "friendship" is at an end. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> pleads to stay, but <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> says he is married and it is too dangerous for her to stay. 

    <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is poisoned and killed.  
When <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> enters and tries to escort her out, she slaps him and runs away. When <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> later asks <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> if she is gone, he says that she boarded the ship. When <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> asks if he saw it sail away, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her, that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>. He then advises <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to go and drink until it feels like he did the right thing.
<entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and Margaery's wedding ceremony takes place in the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of Baelor conducted by the <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> and they are wed in front of gods and men. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> his wedding feast, <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> speaks to the crowd about contemplating history. Out of a large golden lion, five dwarves ride out, representing <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>, <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, and <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>, each of the five kings in the <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>War</entidade> of the Five Kings. The dwarves put on a performance, jousting, fighting, and making crude sexual acts. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>, his brother <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>, and Cersei laugh at the performance. The <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> (Margaery, <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade>, <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade>, and Loras), as well as <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>, Tywin, Tyrion, and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, make little effort to hide their disgust. <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> (riding a mount resembling Loras), and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> is killed after having his wolf's head knocked off. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> expresses his delight with the play and prepares to give the champion dwarf a purse but then mockingly suggests that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> fight him as well. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>, cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is "clearly mad with lust" and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night. <entidade:This>This</entidade> draws a few stifled chuckles from their guests. Enraged and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his wedding guests, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> petulantly pours wine over Tyrion's head and orders him to serve him wine as his cupbearer.
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> approaches <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>, who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> hands the goblet to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, and he fills it with wine and hands it back to <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>. The king demands that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> kneel before him but <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> refuses. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> interrupts the tense moment and says it is time to cut the pigeon pie. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> hands the goblet to <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade>, who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade>. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> draws his new sword, cuts the pie, and several white doves fly out.

    <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> cries over her sons murder.  
<entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> attempt to leave the feast, while <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> serves <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> a piece of pie. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> commands <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to serve him wine to wash down the pie. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> hands the goblet to <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and he quickly drinks all of it. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> tries to speak, but begins coughing. He grabs his throat, and <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> and <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> exclaim that he is choking and needs help. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> collapses face down and begins vomiting and convulsing. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> rush in and turn <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> over on his back. <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> <entidade:Hollard>Hollard</entidade> suddenly approaches <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> from behind and says she must come with him quickly, and she does. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> points an accusatory finger in Tyrion's direction, as he examines the wine goblet (though it is not made clear if <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is accusing <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> or merely the wine). Joffrey's eyes turn red, blood runs from his nose, he stops convulsing, and dies. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> sobs with grief and orders the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> to seize <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> for the poisoning of her son.
