Circumstances change after an unexpected arrival from north of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> must face harsh realities. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> learns more about his destiny. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> sees the truth about his situation.


<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, and <entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade>
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> emerges from the outer gate of the Wall and begins trudging north through the aftermath of the previous night's battle towards <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> Rayder's war camp. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by wildlings, who bring him before <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade>, who notes that he is wearing the black of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> again. <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> brings <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> inside his tent, and questions his status as a traitor. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by Qhorin Halfhand to get <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> to infiltrate Mance's army, and that <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin</entidade> tricked <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> into trusting <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> by allowing <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> to kill <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin</entidade> himself in a fight. <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> asks about <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> reveals that she died at the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, though not by his hands. <entidade:Saddened>Saddened</entidade>, <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> proposes that they drink a toast to her memory, but <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> accepts after <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> assures him that if he'd wanted to kill <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>, poison would be the last of his methods. <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out, and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> informs <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade>. <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> ruefully notes that the giant was named <entidade:Maggy>Mag</entidade> the <entidade:Mighty>Mighty</entidade>, and he was "king" of the giants, the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade> entered <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, to which Jon then glibly notes that his friend <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> was from a farm. They have another toast to <entidade:Maggy>Mag</entidade> and <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade>.
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> then proposes his terms to Mance: <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> is to turn his army around and return home. Mance immediately counters that the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> is low on oil, arrows, and men, and when he sent his full force against the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> threw everything they had at him to repel the attack. Mance guesses there are no more than 50 men left guarding <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, but <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> lies and insists that there are still over 1,000 men defending the garrison. However, Mance calls Jon's bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, and they will attack <entidade:Castle>Castle</entidade> Black's weak southern side as soon as he gives the order. Mance then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the lands south of the Wall; that the wildlings are moving south to seek refuge from the growing threat of the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> just as those south of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> are. <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> then makes his counteroffer: if the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, no more harm will come to the black brothers. However, if his terms are refused, his wildling army will slaughter every last member of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> and move south by force.
<entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> then notices that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is eyeing a cooking knife, and quickly deduces that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> came to parley with <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> simply so he could assassinate him. He notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself, but that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> must have known he would die assassinating <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade>. Mance is shocked and questions <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> if this is what the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> has sunk to: killing a man who let him into his own tent, accepting a parley in good faith, who shared food and drink with him, and who even offered him (relatively) reasonable peace terms. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> hesitates, but before anyone can make a move, war horns are heard from outside. Mance's guards safely grab <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> during the distraction, and <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> demands to know if the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> is attacking them, but <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> admits that it's just as <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> said: the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> doesn't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and attack.
Columns of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> of <entidade:House Baratheon Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, and are led by none other than <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon and <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade>. The wildlings are caught in their own camp, resting from the battle the night before and only expecting attacks from the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, so their eastern flank is completely undefended. As they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry, they are quickly dispatched by Stannis' riders, who attack the wildling camp from both sides in two separate columns that catch the wildlings in a perfect double envelopment. Quickly cutting the wildling forces down, Stannis and <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> ride up to <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade>, who throws down his weapons in surrender, officially ending the wildlings' siege of <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. 
<entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> introduces <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> as the true king of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, but <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> wryly points out that they are not currently in the Seven <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Kingdoms</entidade>. Stannis demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king. Resignedly, <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> says that the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade> do not kneel, knowing that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> will kill him if he does not. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade>, however, asks what a man of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> is doing in the camp, and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> explains that he came to treaty with the King-Beyond-the-Wall. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> says that he knows that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is the true king, as his own father died supporting his claim, revealing himself as the bastard son of <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>. <entidade:This>This</entidade> makes <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> regard <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> more seriously. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> proclaims that Eddard was an honorable man, and asks <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> what <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> would have done with <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade>. Jon responds that <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life, so instead of killing <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> he should be taken prisoner and interrogated. Before they leave the wildling camp, Jon also urges <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> to burn the dead before nightfall. 

    <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> looks through the flames, and sees <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>.  
<entidade:Sack>Back</entidade> at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, a funeral is held for the slain members of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>, who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the castle courtyard. <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> delivers a eulogy, saying that they died to protect the men, women, and children of the south who will never even know who they were, that it is the duty of the surviving black brothers to keep alive their memory. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> closes his speech with the customary line, "and now their watch has ended," which is repeated by the gathered men. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell</entidade> then aids <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> in setting the pyre alight, which is continued by <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and other men carrying torches. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> look on, along with <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> and Princess <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> looks across the flames and catches the gaze of <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>, who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> seems intrigued, her piercing stare clearly making <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> uneasy.
Afterwards, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> enters the chamber of the castle where Tormund is being held. Tormund asks why blind old <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> patched up his arrow wounds, and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> says that <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> is sworn to heal all wounded men, friend or foe. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> asks if <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> really loved <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> doesn't respond. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> says that <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> truly loved him, and that he knew because although she never admitted it, she talked only of killing him, revealing her true feelings for him (if she hadn't loved him, she wouldn't have been so angered by his betrayal). <entidade:Saddened>Saddened</entidade>, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> implores <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that Ygritte's final resting place should be in "the real north." <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> then takes Ygritte's corpse to the north side of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred <entidade:Hearth>Heart</entidade> tree. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre, and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads home.
Far to the north, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark and the <entidade:Jojen Reed>Reed</entidade> children continue their journey to find the Three-eyed raven, though they are on the brink of exhaustion. Jojen <entidade:Jojen Reed>Reed</entidade> has grown sick and and he is barely able to stand, eventually collapsing into the snow. As Meera begs <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> calls out to them, revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> has seen in his visions. As they approach the tree, wights burst up from the snow, grabbing Jojen's ankles and attempting to drag him under the ice. These wights appear far older than those seen near the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility. <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> attempts to defend Jojen from the wights, but they begin to swarm over <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>, who is too scared to fight back. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> wargs into Hodor's mind and begins fighting off the wights with the aid of his direwolf <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>, but more wights keep bursting through the ice and they are quickly overwhelmed.
Just as all seems lost, the wights around <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> suddenly burst into fireballs, and he hears a young girl's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree. <entidade:Amidst>Amidst</entidade> the confusion <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> can fight it off. The mysterious girl calls to <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> and says that <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live. <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> hesitates, but <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> urges her to save herself. Crying, <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> slits her brother's throat to grant him the mercy of a quick death. <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> runs to the cave entrance along with <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>, <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>, and Summer while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights. Just as the life drains from Jojen's eyes, she launches a fireball at his body, immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight (and fulfilling Jojen's vision that his death would involve fire).
They run into the cave, pursued by the wights, who instantly shatter upon crossing the threshold of the cave. The little girl explains that the power which animates the dead corpses is powerless inside the cave. When <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> asks who she is, she replies that "the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade> called us 'the <entidade:Children>Children</entidade>, but we were born long before them." <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> realizes that she is one of the last surviving members of the <entidade:Children>Children</entidade> of the Forest, the original, non-human inhabitants of Westeros who carved the faces into weirwood trees and taught the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade> to worship the <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> Gods thousands of years ago.
The child leads them deeper into the cave, which is overgrown with white weirwood roots from the massive tree above. Other <entidade:Children>Children</entidade> of the <entidade:Haunted Forest>Forest</entidade> peek out around corners as they advance. Finally, they arrive at a large central chamber, its floor littered with bones. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the middle of the cave is an old man seated in the middle of weirwood roots, which have grown around and even through much of his body. Hodor places <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> on the ground and <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> crawls towards the old man, asking if he is the Three-eyed raven who appeared in his visions. The old man admits that he is, having taken several forms in the past, but his true form is before them now. <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> is upset that her brother died to reach him, but the Three-eyed <entidade:Raven>Raven</entidade> says that <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> (who possessed the <entidade:Greensight>Greensight</entidade>, as <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> does) always knew that he would die helping <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> arrive here, but that he came nonetheless. He informs them that he has been watching all of them throughout their entire lives "with a thousand eyes, and one." He continues by stating that Jojen died so that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> could come here and regain what he has lost. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> asks if he means he will regain the use of his legs. The Three-eyed raven replies that <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> will never walk again, "but you will fly."

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> sits in her throne room where she is receiving the day's supplicants. An old man named <entidade:Fennez>Fennesz</entidade> approaches the throne, first speaking in High <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> but then revealing that he also knows the <entidade:Common Tongue>Common Tongue</entidade>. Fennesz explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor, but a well-educated teacher and servant to Master Mighdal, who employed him as a teacher for his own children. He tells <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenarys</entidade> that Master Mighdal's seven year old daughter Calla admires <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade>, having learned of the Targaryen dynasty through Fennesz's teachings.
As a servant of Master Mighdal, Fennesz was well-treated and even well-respected in the household, but when Daenerys forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full-scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people. <entidade:Fennez>Fennesz</entidade> originally stayed in Master Mighdal's house after she took the city, and Mighdal's children begged him to stay, but Mighdal and <entidade:Fennez>Fennesz</entidade> agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals, forcing <entidade:Fennez>Fennesz</entidade> to become homeless. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to house them. <entidade:Fennez>Fennez</entidade> says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe: the young prey on the old, assaulting and robbing them. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> insists that her <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> will restore order, but <entidade:Fennez>Fennesz</entidade> points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety, he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew. Therefore, he has come to <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> to beg her permission to sell himself back to Mighdal. She is shocked that he would want to be owned as a slave again, as a man might own a goat or a chair. He implores her that the young may rejoice in her new world, but for those too old to change, there is only fear and squalor. <entidade:North Edit>Nor</entidade>, he says, is he alone: there are many supplicants waiting outside lining up to make similar requests.
<entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> is crestfallen, and says she did not liberate the slaves of <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy, but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one's own choices. Therefore she will allow <entidade:Fennez>Fennesz</entidade> to enter into a labor contract with Mighdal, but lasting no more than one year. He earnestly thanks her, and leaves. Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> warns <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> that the masters will assuredly take advantage of this, quickly making "contracts" with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but name.
The next supplicant then enters, a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms, similarly to the herdsman who came to show the bones of their livestock which Daenerys's dragons burned in order to be reimbursed. The shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires <entidade:Missandei Naath>Missandei</entidade> to translate. <entidade:Distraught>Distraught</entidade>, he tells Daenarys that the "winged shadow" came, placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred bones - of a human child. Daenerys's largest dragon - the black one, <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> - has roasted the man's three year old daughter <entidade:Zalla>Zalla</entidade> until this is all that was left of her. <entidade:Horrified>Horrified</entidade>, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> meets with <entidade:Missandei Naath>Missandei</entidade> and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>. Grey Worm reports that <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> was last seen flying over the <entidade:Black Cliffs>Black Cliffs</entidade> three days ago, but he can no longer be found. Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons, Daenerys tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, she leads her remaining two dragons, <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade> and <entidade:Viserion>Viserion</entidade>, into the catacombs, where they are distracted by sheep carcasses. As they are feeding, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> personally locks huge iron collars around their necks, which are secured by heavy chains. She weeps as she does so, as it is symbolically reducing her remaining "children" to chained-up slaves themselves. Daenerys wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> Grand <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> Pycelle's laboratory in King's Landing, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade>, and <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> stand over Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Clegane</entidade>, who lies immobilized on a flat wooden table and is revealed to be suffering from a massive wound centered around his right side. <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> informs Cersei that <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade> had coated his spear with manticore venom, poisoning Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade>. The effects are horrific, with Gregor's wounds putrefying and creating a terrible stench. <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> says that he is beyond any hope of recovery, but <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> insists to <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> that he can save him using more unorthodox methods. <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> chaffes at his suggestion, stating that he is not even a maester, and that such arrogance is what led to Qyburn's expulsion from the Citadel in the first place, for experiments that were deemed both dangerous and "unnatural." <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, determined to save <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> from death, dismisses <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> and orders Qyburn to do whatever is necessary, infuriating <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade>, who angrily shuffles out of the laboratory. She asks Qyburn if his treatment will work, and Qyburn claims that if his past work is any indicator, he stands a chance at saving <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade>. Qyburn states that the process will "change" him, although <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> seems only concerned with whether it will weaken him, to which Qyburn replies "Oh no." <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> leaves, and <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> begins syphoning out Gregor's tainted blood.
Cersei approaches Tywin and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade>. He attempts to dismiss the subject by stating that the matter is closed, but she persists and says that it is not just because she does not love Loras: he wants to ship her off to <entidade:Highgarden>Highgarden</entidade> and remove her from the court entirely, keeping her away from her last remaining son. With <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> out of the picture, both Margaery and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> will attempt to get their claws into <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>, each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance. Tywin refuses to budge, so <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> plays her trump card: she threatens to destroy <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> by telling everyone the truth. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> seems confused, and at first <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance. With growing realization, she assesses that even the brilliant <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> never noticed what was going on between his own children, when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is still apparently confused, so with a merciless grin <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> reveals that all of the rumors about her and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> (and their children) are true – she will tell everyone and destroy Tywin's vaunted family legacy, even though it will also mean her death and Tommen's death. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> shakes with barely constrained rage, but in denial he accuses that <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is simply lying to anger him. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> says she doubts he truly thinks that and leaves him standing in his chamber alone.
<entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> finds <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> in the <entidade:White <entidade:White Sword Tower>Sword</entidade> Tower>White <entidade:White Sword Tower>Sword</entidade> Tower</entidade>, and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> killed. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> asserts that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> killed their mother when she gave birth to him. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that, pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened. He insists that Tyrion is her family, whether she chooses to accept it or not. She rebukes his claim, saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice, and that she chooses <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>. She then reveals that she has spilled their secret to <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. He is stunned and concerned by her actions, asking how Tywin reacted to the news, but she states that she does not want to discuss their father. She begins to seduce him, saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world, no longer concerned with whether anyone else knows their secret. He yields to her advances, kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex.
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the middle of the night, Tyrion is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell door being opened by <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> with the assistance of Varys, who has secured a galley in the harbor on which <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> can sneak out of the city and flee to the <entidade:Free Cities>Free Cities</entidade>. He leads <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to a stairway leading up to a locked door, instructing <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, who will lead him to the ship. Before they part ways, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes, unsure if either will ever see the other again.
Tyrion, alone, stares at the door at the top of the staircase, ultimately deciding to use the secret passages of the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> to infiltrate the <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade> of the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>. He enters the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King's quarters, and sees a woman lying in Tywin's bed, with Tywin's clothes folded up on a chair. As he draws closer he sees that the woman is <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, who thinks it is Tywin and calls out for him, calling him "my lion" as she had once done to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. When she turns over and sees that it is Tyrion, looking utterly betrayed, she grabs a knife to defend herself. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> could retreat but instead he rushes forward onto the bed to wrestle it from her grasp. Tyrion manages to knock the knife from her hands and the two continue to struggle violently until Tyrion manages to grab the necklace around her throat (which he once gave her as a gift) and strangles her with it. He continues to strangle her long after she has stopped resisting, until she is dead. He sinks to the floor and sits next to Shae's lifeless body, weeping, and tells her he's sorry. He stares at the wall across the room and sees several weapons on display, among them Joffrey's old crossbow, and his expression quickly darkens.
Tyrion takes the crossbow down from the wall, loads it, and heads down the hall to the privy, opening the door to find his father seated upon the toilet. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> seems surprised to see <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, but quickly regains composure and asks <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to lower the crossbow. He correctly deduces that <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> helped <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> escape his cell, telling <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that they can discuss the matter back in Tywin's chambers. However, when he attempts to stand, Tyrion steadies the crossbow, stopping him dead in his tracks. "All my life you've wanted me dead," Tyrion states, and Tywin acknowledges the validity of his claim. He attempts to defuse the situation by telling <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that despite this, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> has stubbornly clung to life, which <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> states he finds admirable and insists that he was never going to have <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> actually killed. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> admits that he just murdered <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> with his bare hands, but <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> scoffs that it doesn't matter as she was nothing more than a whore. Tyrion is angered by Tywin's indifference and raises the crossbow, threatening that if his father says the word "whore" one more time he will kill him. Tywin balks that Tyrion won't kill his own father in the privy, and again tries to convince <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that they should continue to discuss this in his chambers. Tyrion says he cannot go back to Tywin's chambers because Shae's body is still there. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> dares <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying "because you're afraid of a dead whore?"
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was not bluffing. The moment <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> utters the word "whore" again, Tyrion looses his crossbow bolt, hitting <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> in the belly and knocking him backwards. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is incredulous that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> actually had the courage to fight back against him, and that he will die in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son. As <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> reloads the crossbow, Tywin angrily declares that Tyrion is no son of his. "I am your son," <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> replies quietly, "I have always been your son," and fires a second bolt into Tywin's heart, killing him. Tyrion discards the crossbow as he leaves to find <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>, who immediately realizes <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> has done something terrible, exclaiming "What have you done?" Nonetheless, he leads <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> out of the castle to the docks where Tyrion is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> begins walking back towards the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll, signaling the discovery of Tywin's body. Realizing that returning to the castle is likely unsafe, Varys turns around and heads back for the ship, sitting next to Tyrion's crate in silence as they cast off for <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade>. 
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Vale Arryn>Vale</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:Selwyn Tarth>Tarth</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick</entidade> Payne are heading towards the <entidade:Bloody Gate>Bloody Gate</entidade> when they happen upon <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark practicing her water dancing while <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> is off relieving himself, both returning from the <entidade:Eyrie High>Eyrie</entidade> after receiving words of Lysa Arryn's death. <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> and Arya converse for a moment, both showing respect for one another as they are both women who have fought against what has been expected of them their entire lives. They are interrupted by the return of the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade>, who is immediately recognized by <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick</entidade>, causing <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> to realize that the girl is <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>. Brienne tells <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> of her sacred vow to protect her mother, although she failed to do so because she was sent by her mother to return <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>. The <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> immediately accuses <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> of working for the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, noticing her <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> steel sword  <entidade:Oathkeeper>Oathkeeper</entidade>, which Brienne admits was given to her by <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, frightening Arya into thinking that <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> is working for the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>. Brienne implores <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> to come with her to safety, causing the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> to mock Brienne, pointing out that there is no "safety" for <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> anymore: her aunt <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> in the <entidade:Eyrie High>Eyrie</entidade> – whom <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick</entidade> are seeking out – is dead, as are her father, mother, and older brother, while the <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> armies are scattered and <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> is a smoking ruin. They draw swords and begin fighting, both eventually disarming each other and resorting to brutally fighting each other in hand-to-hand combat. Ultimately, Brienne gains the upper hand (by biting off a chunk of Sandor's ear) and knocks him down a cliff side. <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> goes to search for <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, who slipped away during the melee and has hidden herself amongst the rock formations. As <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick search the surrounding area for Arya in vain, Arya makes her way down the cliff side to find the Hound badly wounded. He tells her that unless there is a maester miraculously on hand to tend to his wounds, he's finished. <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> tells her to kill him and scratch another name off her list, but she just sits and stares at him silently. He grows angry and begins recounting running down the butcher's boy and how he should have raped <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> in an attempt to goad <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> into killing him in anger, but she remains silent. <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> finally begs her to kill him and put him out of his misery, but she quietly refuses and takes his money purse, leaving him screaming at her to kill him as she silently walks away.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> rides a horse to the nearby coast of the <entidade:Vale Arryn>Vale</entidade>, where she sees a wharf with ships docked. She approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, but he says that they won't go there because these days the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> is full of war, cold, and pirates. Instead, the ship is going "home": to the Free <entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> of <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> remembers the special coin that the <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Man</entidade> known as <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar gave her, and instructed her to present to any man from <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade> if she needed aid. She does so now, and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it, but she says only "Valar morghulis" (as <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> instructed), to which the captain gives the traditional response, "Valar dohaeris." He warmly welcomes her aboard the ship, and insists that she will have her own cabin. As the ship casts off, Arya stands aboard the ship and watches as the shore of <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> shrinks further and further away. She then moves to the prow of the ship, looking forward across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade> in the direction of the <entidade:Free Cities>Free Cities</entidade> and <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade>.
