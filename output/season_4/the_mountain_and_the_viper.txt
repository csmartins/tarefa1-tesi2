Unexpected visitors arrive in Mole's Town. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s motives are questioned. Ramsay tries to prove himself to his father. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s fate is decided.


In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
<entidade:Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> sends <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, forced to reassume his former identity of <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>, to treat with the ironborn garrison holding the northern fortress of <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade>, barring the armies of House <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> from returning to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. Theon rides into the fortress to find corpses lying everywhere from constant attacks, and disease is running rampant; the ironborn remaining are sick, under-equipped and outnumbered. The garrison commander, <entidade:Ralf Kenning>Ralf Kenning</entidade>, rebuffs the offer made by Ramsay of safe passage in exchange for surrender, and clearly thinks Theon to be an imposter, but he is cut down by one of his men, who accepts it on behalf of the soldiers. The ironborn surrender to Ramsay, but he has them killed and flayed regardless.
In the aftermath, Ramsay meets with his father and presents him with the <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> banner that was flying over the fortress. In recognition, Roose presents Ramsay with a decree of legitimization, making him officially a member of House <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>. Delighted at the knowledge he will succeed his father as <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, Ramsay and <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> accompany Roose's army as it approaches its final destination: the ruins of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. 
In Mole's Town, a whore is arguing with <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> about her baby who woke her up during the night. Meanwhile, wildlings, including <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>, <entidade:Styr>Styr</entidade> and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>, attack the town, killing everyone in their path. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> discovers <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> hiding with her baby, but urges them to keep quiet, sparing their lives.

At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
News from M​ole's Town has arrived at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, where Sam worries about <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade>, blaming himself for bringing her to the town instead of keeping her with him at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> is angry at them cowering in the castle instead of helping their brothers in neighboring towns. <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> says they can't go out to fight against the wildlings, as that is exactly what they want. <entidade:Pypar>Pypar</entidade> and Edd try to comfort Sam by saying she might be alive and hiding, as she has survived worse situations, such as living with <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>, making a long march to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, and even surviving a <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker. This gives Sam hope that <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and her baby may have survived. Jon notes they have a bigger problem; if Mole's Town has been destroyed, <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> is next, and the few black brothers who remain are outnumbered a thousand to one by <entidade:<entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>'s><entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>'s</entidade> army. Edd notes that if the wildlings don't kill them all, there is even worse behind them that will finish the job, and asks whichever last man of the group is still alive at the end to burn the others, as he doesn't want to come back after he is dead.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
As <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> is swimming with some other <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> outside <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, he notices Missandei and a number of other women bathing naked downstream. She spots him looking at her and returns his gaze, standing up slowly for him to see her before finally covering herself. Later Daenerys asks whether Missandei thinks he was spying on her. She says no, and Daenerys mentions that <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> have no taboos against nudity or public love-making. Of course, Missandei is not <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>, but she says it doesn't matter, as <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> isn't interested in her – none of the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> desire women. Missandei says he was interested though, surprisingly to both of them. Daenerys inquires whether, when a slave is castrated, the masters take "all of it"; both the "pillar" and the "stones." Missandei says she doesn't know, to which Daenerys asks if she's ever wondered. <entidade:Thoughtful>Thoughtful</entidade>, Missandei confirms that she has.
In <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>'s audience chamber, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> comes to apologize to Missandei, but she tells him he doesn't need to. He hopes he didn't frighten her, and she says he did not. Addressing her in the <entidade:Common Tongue>Common Tongue</entidade>, he tells her the lessons she gives are precious to him. Gently correcting his vocabulary, she notes that she doesn't remember teaching him the word "precious." <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> tells her that Jorah taught it to him. She asks whether he remembers his birth name, and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> says he remembers nothing. She asks if he remembers when they cut him, and he shakes his head "no." She tells him she's sorry they did that to him, and when <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> asks her why, she says it's a terrible thing to do to a boy. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> counters that, had the masters not cut him, he never would have been <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>, he never would have been freed, chosen to lead them, and met her. Missandei is visibly moved by this. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> apologizes once again, and she stops him while he turns to leave, telling him she is glad he saw her. He tells her he's glad as well. 
As <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> Selmy watches the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> taking the bodies of the crucified masters down outside <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, a small boy approaches him, giving him a scroll bearing the seal of the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>. He reads its contents slowly in consternation. He confronts <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade>: the document is a royal pardon signed by <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> Baratheon. Barristan surmises Jorah spied on Daenerys in exchange for the pardon. Jorah begs to be allowed to speak with her privately, but Barristan tells him that he will never be alone with her again. In an audience before her, a seething Daenerys demands an explanation, and Jorah says it is a ploy by <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> to divide them. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> counters that the pardon was signed the year they met. Asking him whether he claims the pardon was forged, Jorah admits that it was not. He soon confesses to giving <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> information on Daenerys' activities in <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade>. Daenerys angrily says that his telling them of her pregnancy by <entidade:Khal Drogo>Khal Drogo</entidade> led to her near-poisoning at the hands of a wine merchant. Jorah then protests that his actions stopped her from being poisoned, but Daenerys retorts this was only because he knew it might be coming. Jorah begs for her forgiveness, but Daenerys rebuffs him, saying he betrayed her, selling her secrets to the man she holds responsible for the death of her family. She spares his life, however, and gives him a day to leave <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>. She warns that if he is seen in the city after that, his head will be thrown into <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay. Jorah is last seen riding from <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> on a horse.

In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>
<entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> Baelish is testifying before a tribunal consisting of <entidade:Lord Yohn>Lord Yohn</entidade> Royce, <entidade:Lady Anya <entidade:Waynwood>Waynwood</entidade>>Lady Anya <entidade:Waynwood>Waynwood</entidade></entidade>, and <entidade:Ser Vance <entidade:Corbray>Corbray</entidade>>Ser Vance <entidade:Corbray>Corbray</entidade></entidade>. The lords are suspicious of <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade>'s death, which occured so soon after her marriage. Baelish has been attempting to spin the death as a suicide, but the lords don't believe him, given Lysa's devotion to her son. They rebuff <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s explanations in favor of speaking with the only other witness: his "niece," <entidade:Alayne>Alayne</entidade>. After confirming that Baelish can stay for her testimony, Sansa reveals her true identity and relates the tale of her captivity and escape from <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. She continues, truthfully telling of Lysa's mental instability, jealousy and death, changing only a few details (saying <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> only kissed her on the cheek and Lysa threw herself through the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>). Sansa breaks down in tears and the lords are convinced, but while none of them are looking, she gives <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> a stone-faced look.
Later, Baelish visits Sansa and asks why she lied on his behalf. Sansa explains that she has no idea what Royce, <entidade:Corbray>Corbray</entidade>, and <entidade:Waynwood>Waynwood</entidade> would want from her if he were eliminated, but that she does know what it is he wants. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> seems impressed that she made such a calculating decision, but attempts to cast doubt on her certainty, by asking if she really knows what he wants. Later on, as <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> and Robin prepare to depart on a tour of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>, a raven-haired Sansa accompanies them, in a feathered black dress with a plunging neckline.
At some point, before or after this event, <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> arrive at the <entidade:Bloody Gate>Bloody Gate</entidade> of the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>  and are informed of Lysa's death by <entidade:Ser Donnel <entidade:Waynwood>Waynwood</entidade>>Ser Donnel <entidade:Waynwood>Waynwood</entidade></entidade>. The <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> stares in shock, while <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> begins laughing due to the irony.

At <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
In the last hours before his trial by combat, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Jaime share a final drink in <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s cell and reminisce about <entidade:<entidade:Orson Lannister>Orson</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Orson Lannister>Orson</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, their simple-minded cousin who spent his days smashing beetles with a rock. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> tells Jaime of how he used to observe <entidade:Orson Lannister>Orson</entidade> day after day in an attempt to understand his motives, but in the end he was never able to come to reach any understanding. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> asks Jaime if he thinks Oberyn stands a chance, but Jaime is not optimistic. As a bell rings out to announce daybreak in the city, Jaime takes his leave, wishing his brother luck.
Lannister guardsmen escort <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to the arena, where a large crowd has assembled. He grows apprehensive to find a helm-less Oberyn drinking, and wearing very light armor – in comparison to his opponent, Ser <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, clad from head to foot in heavy armor and wielding a greatsword. Oberyn dismisses <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s concerns, noting that he always drinks before a fight and favors speed over protection. As Gregor and his squire make their way to the arena, Ellaria becomes concerned, noting that The <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade> is the biggest man she's ever seen, but Oberyn remains confident that he will emerge triumphant. Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> steps into the arena and begins making a long-winded speech asking the gods to favor the innocent before <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> cuts him short and begins the trial by combat.
Oberyn, after impressing the crowd with a display of acrobatic spear maneuvers, goes on the attack, stabbing out at Gregor and constantly moving out of the knight's reach, forcing Gregor to tire himself out chasing his opponent. As he evades Gregor, Oberyn repeatedly taunts Gregor by constantly bringing up his part in the murder of his sister, <entidade:<entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> Martell><entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> Martell</entidade>, and her children, and demanding a confession, only enraging Clegane further. As the fight progresses, Oberyn manages to seriously injure Gregor, stabbing him first in the chest, severing his hamstring and then burying his spear in <entidade:Gregor's>Gregor's</entidade> stomach, pinning him to the floor. As Jaime and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> exchange a relieved grin across the arena, a furious Oberyn circles the prone Gregor, demanding that before he dies, Gregor confess to murdering <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> and her children, raping <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade>, and that it was <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> who gave the order.
However, Oberyn stands too close to his seemingly defeated opponent, and Gregor manages to trip and seize him. <entidade:Berserk>Berserk</entidade> with fury, Gregor grabs Oberyn by the throat and lifts him off the ground, smashing out most of his teeth with a single devastating punch. Climbing on top of Oberyn, Gregor finally admits for all to hear that he raped and killed <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> as he gouges out Oberyn's eyes with his thumbs before crushing the <entidade:Viper>Viper</entidade>'s skull between his hands, which he proclaims having done the same to his sister. As Ellaria screams in horror, a stunned silence sweeps over the crowd. The short joyful moments for <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Jaime are shattered, as <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> stands and proclaims the will of the gods is clear: <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is guilty and sentenced to death. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> cannot even reply, shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at Oberyn's skull-crushed corpse, as does Jaime; the only different reaction is from Cersei, who stares at Oberyn's slaughtered body, listening to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s death sentence while smirking in vindication.
