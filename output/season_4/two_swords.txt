Summary
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> has the ancestral <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> steel greatsword <entidade:Ice Cells>Ice</entidade> (held by the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> since <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark's execution) melted down and re-forged into two smaller swords, after which he burns the wolf pelt scabbard the greatsword was held in. He presents one to his son <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> as a gift. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is impressed, as the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> have never previously owned a <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> steel sword. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> tells him he acquired the original sword from "someone who no longer needed it" and then commissioned a <entidade:Bridge Volantis>Volantis</entidade> blacksmith to re-forge it. He wants <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> to be his heir and return home to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>, but <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> insists <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> remaining in the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>. Furious at Jaime's disobedience and lack of ambition, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> rebuffs him. He tells <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> to keep the sword anyway. 
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> wait <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> a road outside the city for the arrival of <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade> of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, who has been invited to the royal wedding. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> quizzes Bronn on the sigils of the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Dornish</entidade> houses, none of which he knows, however Podrick answers perfectly. Lord Blackmont approaches them <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> horseback and says <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> is in poor health and remained at <entidade:Sunspear>Sunspear</entidade>. Doran's brother, <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>, will be attending the wedding in his stead, and arrived before dawn. Assigning the reception of the Dornish Lords to the City Watch, Tyrion says they should find Oberyn as soon as possible "before he kills somebody or several somebodies".
<entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> and his bastard paramour <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade> are examining prostitutes in a brothel owned by <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade>, but currently managed by <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade>, as <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> is now in the <entidade:Vale Arryn>Vale</entidade>. They choose the contortionist <entidade:Marei>Marei</entidade>, and <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> orders <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> to get undressed also. Oberyn is infuriated when he hears men singing The Rains of Castamere. He confronts the two <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade> soldiers, who insult him and <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade>. <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> moves closer and chastises them for being "pink little men who are far too slow <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> the draw" rather than being "golden lions". One of the soldiers reaches for his sword, and <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> quickly stabs him through the wrist with a dagger and tells the other that his friend will only live if he immediately gets help. Tyrion and <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> enter, and Oberyn and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> step outside to speak privately. <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> says he wants revenge for the murder of his niece <entidade:Rhaenys>Rhaenys</entidade>, his nephew <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade>, and the rape and murder of his sister <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> in the sack of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> by <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade> troops during Robert's Rebellion. He wants <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Clegane</entidade>, who murdered <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade>, and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>, whom <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> believes gave the order for <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> and her children to be killed.
Tyrion, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, and another handmaiden are sitting in a garden. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is still distraught over the deaths of her brother and mother. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> attempts to console his wife but fails; <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> has heard the gruesome details of the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade>, how the corpses of her mother and brother were desecrated. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> then leaves for the godswood, not to pray but because it is the only place no one talks to her. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> returns and finds <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> in his bed. He scolds her because no one can find out about their relationship. She attempts to seduce him but he resists. She accuses him of trying to bribe her with diamonds and ship her away to the <entidade:Free Cities>Free Cities</entidade>, but he doesn't know what she's talking about (Varys did this acting alone). She angrily leaves the room but is spotted by the handmaiden, who is hiding behind a pillar.
Jaime, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, and <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> are in Cersei's chambers. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> has had a golden prosthetic hand made for <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, and Qyburn attaches it to Jaime's stump. Qyburn asks <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> about her symptoms, and she says they are gone. After <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> departs, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> tells her that he will stay in the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> with one hand so he can stay close to her, then tries to kiss her, but she turns away, much to Jaime's confusion and anger. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> implies that she has taken other lovers and that their relationship has changed because of his lengthy absence, a statement that clearly wounds <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>. The handmaiden suddenly enters and says she has important information for <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>.
As preparations for the royal wedding continue, <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> and her grandmother <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> are interrupted by <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:Selwyn Tarth>Tarth</entidade>, (Olenna being delighted to see the truth of the rumors about Brienne) who requests a private word with <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade>. <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> tells <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> the truth of Renly's death and vows to one day exact revenge <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>, whom she holds responsible. They walk past a statue of <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> standing over a dead direwolf, commemorating the victory over the northern rebellion.
Elsewhere in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> and <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> discuss security at the upcoming wedding. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is clearly irked by Joffrey's arrogance as well as Meryn's sycophantic agreement with the king's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed (Jaime notes that this is more the doing of the Tyrells) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> (who had previously noted to his father that thousands in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> alone still want <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> dead) points out that the war is far from won; <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is still alive and will probably raise fresh armies. Dismissive of the threat posed by <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> following the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> leafs through the <entidade:Book Brothers>Book</entidade> of <entidade:Sworn Brothers>Brothers</entidade>, which details the history of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> and those who served in it. He reads Jaime's brief entry and sneers that someone must have forgotten to record all of his uncle's great deeds. He also questions Jaime's ability to serve in the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> with one hand. Jaime defensively quips that using his left hand makes for more of a challenge.
As Sansa prays alone in the godswood, she is watched by <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and Brienne; <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> expects <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> to uphold his oath to return <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> Stark's daughters in return for his freedom, but <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> counters by pointing out the situation is complicated by Catelyn's death and Sansa's marriage to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. As <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is leaving the godswood, she is approached by <entidade:Dontos>Dontos</entidade> <entidade:Hollard>Hollard</entidade>, who thanks her for convincing <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> to spare his life and gives her what he claims to be his mother's necklace as a token of gratitude.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
<entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> and <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> stand outside a stone ravine. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> chides her for failing to finish off <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>. Suddenly, their scouts signal that someone is approaching. <entidade:Styr>Styr</entidade> and a band of Thenn approach them through the ravine. Out of earshot, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> comments about how much he hates Thenns. Styr says his party raided a village south of the ravine and gathered meat. He says the meat tastes so much better south of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, and chides <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> for losing their warg as well as <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>. He reminds <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> how the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> are feasting and getting fat at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. Styr suggests that <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> taste crow meat before he dies, as a human arm roasts over a fire.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> has survived the injuries inflicted by <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> and has largely recovered, though he still grimaces while getting dressed and walks with a slight limp. <entidade:Having>Having</entidade> been told of Robb's death, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> shares with <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> that he had always been jealous of <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> for having more of their father's affection and for being better than him at riding and fighting, and with girls. Despite all this, he says he could never bring himself to hate <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> responds by saying he has felt the same way about <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>, that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is better than him at everything (except reading). 
It turns out that <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> had been sent to retrieve <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>, who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers, including <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade>, acting <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade>, <entidade:First Builder>First Builder</entidade> <entidade:Othell Yarwyck>Othell Yarwyck</entidade>, and the exiled former <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> <entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>, <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade>. Both <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> and <entidade:Janos Slynt>Slynt</entidade> are openly hostile to <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>, disbelieving much of what he says. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the hearing, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> admits to killing <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin Halfhand</entidade> but says that it was not murder, rather <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin</entidade> wanted <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> to kill him to give <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> credibility with the wildlings in order to get a spy into Mance's army. <entidade:Janos Slynt>Slynt</entidade> dismisses <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> as "the bastard son of a traitor" while <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade>, a friend of Qhorin's, reacts with incredulity that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> would presume to act like he knew the <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Halfhand</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> responds by saying that <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> should know that <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin</entidade> would have done anything to protect the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>.
When <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> refers to the wildlings as "Free Folk," Slynt accuses him of going native, to the extent he even talks like them. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> snaps back, acknowledging that he talks like a wildling and also admits to living amongst the wildlings, eating with them, and climbing the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> with them. He catches himself before admitting that he lay with one, but says it anyway. <entidade:Janos Slynt>Slynt</entidade> calls for Jon's execution for breaking one of his vows. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> points out the impracticality of executing every ranger who lays with a girl and says that "the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> would be manned by headless men." <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> says that there is a difference between sneaking off to a brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> does not defend himself at this point. Instead, he says that <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade> intends to attack the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> with his army of 100,000 wildlings and gives intelligence <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> Mance's plan of attack. Both <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> and <entidade:Janos Slynt>Slynt</entidade> disbelieve what <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> has to say. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade>, however, realizes that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is speaking the truth, and the hearing ends with <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> being allowed to keep his head, although after <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> leaves, <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> expresses his distrust for <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> and the "Hound" <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> are still traveling through the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> a single horse. They pass by overturned carts and dead bodies, including those of children. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks when she is going to get her own horse, complaining of the Hound's stench. He scoffs at the idea, noting that horses are hard to come by and that he wouldn't give <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> her own horse (even if one was available) as she is the only thing of value he has since he did not take anything of value when he left King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> assures him she has no plans to run off, saying that she would die by nightfall without him as she has no one to go to. The <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> reminds her that she still has an aunt in the <entidade:Vale Arryn>Vale</entidade>, <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade>, to whom he plans to ransom <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>.
The two eventually come upon a tavern. Both hungry, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> suggests that they attack the men there, to which the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> expresses reluctance as there are five men. Just then, two men exit to relieve themselves. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> recognizes one of them as <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade>, the <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Lannister</entidade> man-at-arms who had previously taken Arya's sword <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> and killed her friend <entidade:Lommy Greenhands>Lommy</entidade>. She also notices that <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> still has <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> and runs off to get it back. The <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> chases after her, stopping her at the tavern's door, but they are seen and choose to go in anyways.
It is clear that <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> and the other men are making trouble and intend to rape the tavern owner's daughter. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> go to a table far away from everyone else, but <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> still recognizes the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> and walks over to their table and strikes up a conversation. He does not recognize <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, who he thinks is just the Hound's latest sexual conquest. <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> implies that he and his men intend to rape and pillage <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> their way back to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and invites the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> to come along. <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> says that he and his men wear the King's colors and can do whatever they like, to which the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> leans forward and states emphatically, "Fuck the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>."
The conversation then becomes tense and turns into a standoff. They eventually draw their swords. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> first, the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> fights the five men alone while <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> stands in the corner. He easily dispatches two of them and fights off the rest, stabbing one in the groin. Another, however, gets him <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> the ground, holding a dagger to his throat. The <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> is able to fight him off, stabbing him repeatedly in the head with his own dagger.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> then joins the fray, smashing a pot over the head of one of the men and stabbing him with his own long sword. She then slashes Polliver's leg from behind, causing him to fall to the ground. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> takes <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> from <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> and stands over his prone form. She echoes what he had said to <entidade:Lommy Greenhands>Lommy</entidade> just before he killed him, though <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> still doesn't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> then repeats what he had said to her when he took Needle: "Fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it." It is at that point when <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> recognizes her and becomes frightened. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> then kills <entidade:Polliver>Polliver</entidade> in the same way he had killed <entidade:Lommy Greenhands>Lommy</entidade> by driving <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> slowly into his throat. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> then leave the tavern, taking with them a horse for Arya and a chicken the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> wanted.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
Daenerys Targaryen sits near the sea with her three dragons, each one about the size of a small horse. Daenerys strokes Drogon's head, while Rhaegal and Viserion fight over a dead lamb, <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> joins the fight. As Daenerys tries to calm him down, without warning, <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> snaps at her with a hiss, a warning to not interfere. He then roars and goes to contest the kill.

    <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> snarls a warning at his mother.  
<entidade:This>This</entidade> act, that her own children would threaten her, and that they are outgrowing her influence and ability to rein them, leaves Daenerys visibly shaken. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> approaches and tells her that dragons can never be tamed, not even by their mother.
<entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> returns to her <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> army to resume the march to <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>. She notices <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade> are absent and sets out to find them after being told they are "gambling". She finds the two men sitting face-to-face holding their swords in front of them; they have been contesting their strength since midnight. <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> explains they are deciding <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> which of them will ride up front with her in the vanguard. Frustrated, Daenerys states that the honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as they did not keep her waiting all morning. She orders the two men to ride at the back with the livestock. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> also adds that the last man holding his sword shall find a new queen to fight for and both men immediately drop their weapons.
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> the road to <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> speaks with <entidade:Missandei Naath>Missandei</entidade>, who tells her queen that <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> would be wise to fear her approach. <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> meets them <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>on</entidade> the cliff side, and <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> expresses her annoyance when he shows her flowers he has picked. He reveals that the flowers represent a portrait of the landscape, and serve various purposes, chiefly that knowing her surroundings is important to Daenerys' strategy.
The marching army halts, and <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> goes to the forefront, discovering a slave child crucified upon a cross. The child is dead, her hand pointing the way to <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, and Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> tells <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> there is one for each mile to the last of the great slave cities, 163 in total. Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> offers to have outriders go ahead to bury them, but <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> refuses, ordering that each of them be buried, and their collars removed, but not before she has looked upon each and every face.
