<entidade:Summary>Summary</entidade>
Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
In her new headquarters atop the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Pyramid, Daenerys learns that Joffrey is dead and <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> has been crwoned. She is irritated to learn that <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade> has captured Meereen's navy without her explicit orders to do so, but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> and taking King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> with her 8,000 <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> and 2,000 <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>. <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> is optimistic about their chances, believing that old <entidade:Westerosi>Westerosi</entidade> families will flock to their cause once Daenerys crosses the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>, swelling their numbers. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> is less enthusiastic: while 10,000 troops should be enough to take King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> from its exhausted defenders, there's still the rest of the continent to worry about. Her advisors then reveal more troubling news: the <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise Masters</entidade> have bounced back and re-enslaved every freed man in <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>, and although <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade> remains free, the council Daenerys installed has been deposed by a butcher named <entidade:Cleon>Cleon</entidade>. Daenerys dismisses everyone but Jorah and muses that her plans are in shambles. He reminds her that she is the last <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> and the <entidade:Mother>Mother</entidade> of Dragons, but <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> says she needs to be more than that. She laments that if she cannot keep order in three cities, she has no hope of controlling seven kingdoms. She is therefore resolved to remain in Meereen and "do what queens do": rule.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
<entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> is crowned king of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>, while Cersei makes what appears to be a peaceful gesture towards Margaery, who remains wary. Cersei talks to <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> Oberyn and asks him a favor. She hasn't seen her daughter, Myrcella, in over a year. Cersei asks Oberyn to take her a gift, a ship, since she missed her last nameday. 
​Tywin reveals to Cersei their problem with the <entidade:Iron Bank>Iron Bank</entidade> of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>; they owe 'a tremendous sum,' and the gold mines of the <entidade:Westerlands>Westerlands</entidade> actually ran dry three years ago. <entidade:Therefore>Therefore</entidade>, even though Tywin admits the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> can trust nobody except themselves, they need the Tyrells' wealth and resources on their side. Cersei suggests coming to some arrangement with one of their representatives, but Tywin dismisses the idea, since the Bank is a monolithic structure that cannot be avoided, lied to or swayed.

In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>
While on the road, Podrick proves to be a hindrance to <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>. He has problems with his horse and accidentally sets fire to a rabbit they were cooking. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> tries to get rid of Podrick by releasing him from the vow he swore as her squire, but to no avail. They are bound for <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, where <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> believes Sansa may have taken refuge with her half-brother, <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> questions Podrick about his duties as squire to Tyrion. He tells her his job was mostly pouring wine, alongside other menial tasks. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> then asks if Podrick did anything related to combat. Podrick reveals how he killed Ser <entidade:<entidade:Mandon Moore>Mandon</entidade> Moore><entidade:Mandon Moore>Mandon</entidade> Moore</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> by shoving a spear through his head when he tried to kill Tyrion during the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> then grants Podrick a bit of respect and allows him to help her remove her armor.

In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> of Arryn
Lord <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> and <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> arrive safely at the <entidade:Bloody Gate>Bloody Gate</entidade>, though Petyr has Sansa cover her hair, as auburn is widely known as a Tully trait, and introduces her as his niece, <entidade:Alayne>Alayne</entidade>. <entidade:Upon>Upon</entidade> arriving at the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade> itself, Sansa tries to slip into her alias, but <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> tells her not to bother around her own flesh and blood. Lysa laments Sansa's treatment in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, ignoring her attempts to defend Tyrion's character. <entidade:<entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> Arryn><entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> Arryn</entidade> is delighted to see Petyr and to show Sansa the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>. Lysa, apparently having finally given <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> some independence, reminds him never to reveal Sansa's identity and tells him to show her to her chambers. The instant they leave, Lysa, for unclear reasons, insists on marrying Petyr immediately, claiming that they already had a wedding night many years ago. She references poisoning her former husband's wine and framing the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> by writing to her sister Catelyn, using these actions as proof of her love for Petyr. Petyr is unable to deter her, particularly when Lysa reveals that a Septon and witnesses have been waiting outside the main door. A delighted Lysa declares that she will scream so loudly that night that they will be able to hear her across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night, an exasperated Sansa attempts to sleep as Lysa tries to fulfil that promise.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> on, Lysa has a meal with Sansa, giving her some lemon cakes. Sansa, relieved to be safe at last, indulges herself, though she becomes a little self-conscious when Lysa begins telling stories of Catelyn's overeating in her youth. Lysa encourages Sansa to keep eating, as she was only telling a story, and anyway, Petyr had three crates of lemons brought from the <entidade:Crownlands>Crownlands</entidade> just for Sansa's cakes. Lysa suddenly degenerates from a kindly aunt into a psychotic newlywed half-mad with jealousy and demands to know why Petyr cares so much about Sansa, and if he has slept with her as he has his whores. She also rants about Catelyn's love for Sansa's uncle <entidade:Brandon>Brandon</entidade> and how he nearly killed Petyr. <entidade:Horrified>Horrified</entidade>, Sansa weeps and insists that she is still a virgin and that Petyr thinks she's just a stupid girl who doesn't know anything, and who cannot lie at all so always tells the truth. Lysa immediately calms down and comforts Sansa, assuring her that she believes her, and that since neither Tyrion nor Petyr had slept with her, Sansa can proceed to marry <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade>. Sansa seems unsure of what to make of this information, but one thing is clear: King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> has made her a consummate actress.
On the road to the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> Clegane><entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> Clegane</entidade> and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade> continue to spar verbally and physically, particularly when Clegane disparages Arya's water dancing and insults <entidade:<entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade> for being overcome by a glorified thug like <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade>.

<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> scouts the keep for the party of the Night's Watch sent to eliminate the traitors holed up there; in his reconnaissance, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> finds the hut where <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran Stark</entidade>, Jojen, Meera and <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> are being held captive. Reporting back to <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> and the others, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> tells them that only 11 traitors are present and most of them are drunk and won't prove much of a threat. He also lies about the hut where the prisoners are being kept, claiming there are hounds kept inside and that they should keep away from it to prevent the dogs alerting their enemy. Jon agrees and tells the party they attack at nightfall.
That night, <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> enters the prisoners' hut and attempts to rape Meera, but Jojen distracts <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> when he reveals his possession of greensight and claims to have seen <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> dead before the night is out. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> that moment, <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade> rushes in to warn <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> the keep is under attack; Jon's party rushes through the defenses and starts killing their traitorous former brethren. In the confusion, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> slips into the tent and attempts to abduct Bran, but Bran wargs into <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> and uses him to kill <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade>. Bran spots Jon in the fighting, but Jojen prevents him from going to his older brother, reminding Bran that they must continue onward to reach the three-eyed raven and that Jon would stop them. Bran reluctantly leaves despite being so close to Jon.​
The Night's Watch swiftly overcome their enemy and Jon confronts <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> in single combat. <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade>'s use of dirty tactics learned in his criminal past give him the upper hand. Before he can finish Jon, one of <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s wives, <entidade:Sissy>Sissy</entidade>, stabs him from behind. When <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade> rounds on her, Jon gets back to his feet and drives <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade> through the back of <entidade:Karl Tanner>Karl</entidade>'s skull, killing him.
In the aftermath of the battle, four brothers of the Night's Watch, including <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade>, are found to have died, while all the traitors but one are accounted for. The sole survivor, <entidade:Rast>Rast</entidade>, runs in terror through the forest until he reaches the cage where <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> was held. He notices someone has opened the cage but before he can do more than absorb this fact, the direwolf lunges out of nowhere and kills him. <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> then finds his way back to Jon, who is overjoyed to see his companion again. Speaking to <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s wives, Jon warns them that <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>'s army and worse besides will soon reach their location and offers to take them to safety south of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, but the women refuse, preferring to set out on their own. Before departing back for <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, Jon has <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep burned to the ground, along with the bodies of all those who died there.
