<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> enlists an unlikely ally. Daario entreats <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> to allow him to do what he does best. <entidade:Jon’s>Jon’s</entidade> warnings about the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>’s vulnerability fall on deaf ears. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> follows a new lead on the road with Pod.


At <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
    <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>  
In his cell, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Jaime discuss <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s fate and the irony of <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade></entidade> striking down both his heirs if Jaime were to die being <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s champion; Jaime declines to be <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s champion as he cannot fight well enough with his left hand. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> then requests Jaime to bring him <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, hoping the sellsword will stand for him just as he did at the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>.
<entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> visits <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> in the clothes of a lord, having been betrothed to <entidade:<entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> Stokeworth><entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> Stokeworth</entidade>, by Cersei's doing. He refuses to fight the <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade> (whom Cersei has chosen for her champion), both for lack of a reward and believing Clegane is too dangerous for him to face, and bids farewell to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, who while heartbroken by <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>'s decision, understands.

    Oberyn visits <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> in his cell.  
Later, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is approached by <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn Martell</entidade>, who tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> of his disappointment in their first encounter: as children, Oberyn and his sister <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> were told stories of the "<entidade:Lannister Monster>Lannister Monster</entidade>" and his extreme deformities. During a childhood visit to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>, Cersei showed <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, with great ceremony, to Oberyn and <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade>. Oberyn tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he saw no monster, just a baby. Cersei told Oberyn and his sister that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> killed her mother, and then cruelly assaulted <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> until Jaime stopped her. Oberyn says that he and <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia</entidade> were quite disturbed at Cersei's already strong hatred toward <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, who is disturbed by Cersei's relentless hatred as his eyes tear up. Oberyn tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he seeks justice for the death of his sister, and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> replies, "You are in the wrong place." Oberyn counters that he is in the perfect place; all those he means to bring to justice for his sister's murder are close at hand. Intending to start his revenge with <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, Oberyn offers his service as <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s champion in the coming trial by combat.

     
<entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, known by most as 'the <entidade:Mountain>Mountain</entidade>,' is mercilessly killing prisoners with a greatsword. Cersei approaches him and thanks him for his haste in returning to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> as her champion for the trial by combat. Gregor asks who he will be fighting, Cersei asks if it matters, and he shakes his head.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daario visits Daenerys in her private chambers.  Daenerys is surprised by Daario in her private chambers. She feigns outrage at the intrusion, but agrees to hear his complaints. Daario laments that he is only good at two things, killing men and sleeping with women, and that he has no opportunities to pursue either strength. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> counters that the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> are currently acting as <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>'s police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him; Daario dismisses the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants isn't interested. He begs Daenerys to send him and the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> to make real war. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> focuses on Daario's other proclaimed talent and orders him to remove his clothes.
The following morning, Daario bumps into <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade>. He also says that it's a good time to talk to the queen, as she is in a very good mood, implying that he and Daenerys had just been intimate. Jorah is not amused, but Daenerys dismisses concerns about her intimate life. Daenerys tells Jorah that she sent Daario to take the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> to <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> to regain control over the city and kill the masters that have resurfaced. Jorah relates to the mercy shown by <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> for his dealings in slavery and convinces Daenerys to bring the masters to justice without execution. Daenerys considers for a moment and then tells Jorah to assign <entidade:<entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade>><entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade></entidade> as her ambassador to offer the masters a choice: they can live free in the new world she wants to create, or they can die clinging to their old one. The <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> will be stationed in <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> to enforce whichever choice the masters make. She also says to let Daario know that it was Jorah who changed her mind.

At <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>
    <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> speaks with <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>.  <entidade:Queen <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade>>Queen <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade></entidade> speaks to <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>, who is enjoying a bath. She quips that the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath, but the joke goes over <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade>'s head. To cement <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade>'s position as <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s most devoted follower, the Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade> tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on. <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> asks her if she used the potions when she slept with <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, to which she replies that she did not. <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is as dismissive about <entidade:Shireen's>Shireen's</entidade> "heresy" as she always is, and assures <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> that Shireen will be needed where they are going.
At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
Jon and his fellow brothers return from <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep. At first sight of his direwolf, <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> Thorne><entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> Thorne</entidade> sends his "beast" away, outside <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>.
Afterwards, Jon tries to convince the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> to barricade the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> against the imminent wildling invasion by blocking off <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>'s entry tunnel with ice and rock. He is denied after being reminded of his place in the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, when the <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> Builder reluctantly agrees with Thorne's assessment of their chances of defending the tunnel. Jon and Sam are sent to serve as sentries on top of the <entidade:<entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> until Mance><entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> until Mance</entidade> arrives.

In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and Sandor encounter a ​dying man in a ransacked village. Sandor gives the man a gift of mercy by stabbing him in the heart. Sandor is ambushed by <entidade:Biter>Biter</entidade>, and is bitten on the neck. He snaps <entidade:Biter>Biter</entidade>'s neck and drops him dead in the dirt. <entidade:Rorge>Rorge</entidade> encounters them and after a short interrogation is killed by <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> with a quick thrust by <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> to his heart. <entidade:Afterward>Afterward</entidade>, Sandor clumsily addresses his wounds from <entidade:Biter>Biter</entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> suggests burning to cauterize the wound, but is rebuffed by Sandor's fear of fire. Sandor confirms the story of his facial scars from burns inflicted by <entidade:Gregor's>Gregor's</entidade> wrath and how his father covered up the truth, making him feel alone. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> offers to clean and stitch him up, and Sandor allows her to.

     
Meanwhile, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick stop at an inn where they are served kidney pie made by none other than <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade>, who proceeds to tell them at length the process in finding the right ingredients. He then asks of <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>'s business, to which she replies that she is in <entidade:Lady Stark>Lady Stark</entidade>'s service to find and protect <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade> leaves after addressing the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> as traitors. As <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick prepare to leave the inn, Podrick reminds <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> that telling people of their quest could be dangerous, but <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>'s honesty is swiftly rewarded when <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade> approaches and gives them a loaf of bread shaped like a wolf. He tells them that he knows nothing of Sansa, but has seen her sister <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> alive, along with the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> is surprised because <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> has been presumed dead since she disappeared when her father <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> was executed. They deduce that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s captors are probably going to try to ransom <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> somewhere. Having memorized the complex family trees of the Great <entidade:Houses Reyne>Houses</entidade>, Podrick surmises that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s aunt <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> is the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>'s only remaining chance of a reward for her. Therefore, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick decide to head for the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>.

At the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>
While wandering the <entidade:Eyrie –>Eyrie</entidade>'s snow-covered courtyards, Sansa builds a snow replica of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Robin chances upon her and seems impressed with her efforts. The cousins get along until Robin asks where the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade> is. Sansa tells him <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> doesn't need a <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>. Sansa agrees to add one, but in the process, Robin accidentally knocks over a tower. Robin insists she replicate the tower. This irritates Sansa and Robin throws a tantrum in response. Unable to control her anger, Sansa slaps Robin. Sansa immediately softens and tries to apologize, but before she can Robin threatens to tell his mother and runs away. <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> Baelish witnesses the action and assures Sansa that he will deal with Lysa, whom he says should discipline her child more often, anyway. <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> muses on how he should have been Sansa's father, but then tells Sansa that she is more beautiful than her mother Catelyn and kisses Sansa; who is so shocked that she doesn't resist. Unknown to the pair, the kiss is seen by Lysa.

    Lysa is pushed out the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>.  
Later, Sansa is summoned by Lysa, who proceeds to explain the gory details about <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade> executions. Lysa then grabs Sansa and threatens to throw her out for kissing <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade>. She is stopped when <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> arrives and swears by everything he can think of that he will send Sansa away. Lysa releases Sansa and embraces <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade>, who assures Lysa that he only ever loved one woman - her sister. Lysa has only an instant to contemplate this betrayal, as <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> shoves her out of the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade> and looks down as she plummets to her death hundreds of feet below.
