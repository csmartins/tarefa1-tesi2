Tyrion enlists an unlikely ally. Daario entreats <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> to allow him to do what he does best. Jon’s warnings about the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>’s vulnerability fall on deaf ears. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> follows a new lead on the road with Pod.


<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
    Tyrion and <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>  
In his cell, Tyrion and Jaime discuss Tyrion's fate and the irony of Lord Tywin striking down both his heirs if Jaime were to die being Tyrion's champion; Jaime declines to be Tyrion's champion as he cannot fight well enough with his left hand. Tyrion then requests Jaime to bring him <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, hoping the sellsword will stand for him just as he did at the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>.
<entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> visits Tyrion in the clothes of a lord, having been betrothed to <entidade:<entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> Stokeworth><entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> Stokeworth</entidade>, by Cersei's doing. He refuses to fight the <entidade:The Mountain>Mountain</entidade> (whom Cersei has chosen for her champion), both for lack of a reward and believing Clegane is too dangerous for him to face, and bids farewell to Tyrion, who while heartbroken by <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>'s decision, understands.

    Oberyn visits Tyrion in his cell.  
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, Tyrion is approached by <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn Martell</entidade>, who tells Tyrion of his disappointment in their first encounter: as children, Oberyn and his sister Elia were told stories of the "<entidade:Lannister Monster>Lannister Monster</entidade>" and his extreme deformities. During a childhood visit to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>, Cersei showed Tyrion, with great ceremony, to Oberyn and Elia. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he saw no monster, just a baby. Cersei told Oberyn and his sister that Tyrion killed her mother, and then cruelly assaulted Tyrion until Jaime stopped her. Oberyn says that he and Elia were quite disturbed at Cersei's already strong hatred toward Tyrion, who is disturbed by Cersei's relentless hatred as his eyes tear up. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he seeks justice for the death of his sister, and Tyrion replies, "<entidade:You>You</entidade> are in the wrong place." Oberyn counters that he is in the perfect place; all those he means to bring to justice for his sister's murder are close at hand. Intending to start his revenge with <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, Oberyn offers his service as Tyrion's champion in the coming trial by combat.

     
<entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade>, known by most as 'the <entidade:The Mountain>Mountain</entidade>,' is mercilessly killing prisoners with a greatsword. Cersei approaches him and thanks him for his haste in returning to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> as her champion for the trial by combat. Gregor asks who he will be fighting, Cersei asks if it matters, and he shakes his head.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    Daario visits Daenerys in her private chambers.  Daenerys is surprised by Daario in her private chambers. She feigns outrage at the intrusion, but agrees to hear his complaints. Daario laments that he is only good at two things, killing men and sleeping with women, and that he has no opportunities to pursue either strength. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> counters that the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> are currently acting as Meereen's police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him; Daario dismisses the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants isn't interested. He begs Daenerys to send him and the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> to make real war. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> focuses on Daario's other proclaimed talent and orders him to remove his clothes.
The following morning, Daario bumps into Ser Jorah. He also says that it's a good time to talk to the queen, as she is in a very good mood, implying that he and Daenerys had just been intimate. Jorah is not amused, but Daenerys dismisses concerns about her intimate life. Daenerys tells Jorah that she sent Daario to take the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> to <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> to regain control over the city and kill the masters that have resurfaced. Jorah relates to the mercy shown by <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> for his dealings in slavery and convinces Daenerys to bring the masters to justice without execution. Daenerys considers for a moment and then tells Jorah to assign <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade> as her ambassador to offer the masters a choice: they can live free in the new world she wants to create, or they can die clinging to their old one. The <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> will be stationed in <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> to enforce whichever choice the masters make. She also says to let Daario know that it was Jorah who changed her mind.

    <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> speaks with <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>.  Queen <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> speaks to <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>, who is enjoying a bath. She quips that the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath, but the joke goes over <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade>'s head. To cement <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade>'s position as <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s most devoted follower, the <entidade:Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade> tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on. <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> asks her if she used the potions when she slept with Stannis, to which she replies that she did not. <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the North but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is as dismissive about Shireen's "heresy" as she always is, and assures <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> that Shireen will be needed where they are going.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
Jon and his fellow brothers return from <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> first sight of his direwolf, <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade>, <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> sends his "beast" away, outside <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>.
Afterwards, Jon tries to convince the Night's Watch to barricade the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> against the imminent wildling invasion by blocking off <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>'s entry tunnel with ice and rock. He is denied after being reminded of his place in the Watch, when the <entidade:First Builder>First Builder</entidade> reluctantly agrees with Thorne's assessment of their chances of defending the tunnel. Jon and Sam are sent to serve as sentries on top of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> until Mance arrives.

In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>
Arya and <entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> encounter a ​dying man in a ransacked village. <entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> gives the man a gift of mercy by stabbing him in the heart. <entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> is ambushed by <entidade:Biter>Biter</entidade>, and is bitten on the neck. He snaps <entidade:Biter>Biter</entidade>'s neck and drops him dead in the dirt. <entidade:Rorge>Rorge</entidade> encounters them and after a short interrogation is killed by Arya with a quick thrust by <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> to his heart. <entidade:Afterward>Afterward</entidade>, <entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> clumsily addresses his wounds from <entidade:Biter>Biter</entidade>. Arya suggests burning to cauterize the wound, but is rebuffed by <entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade>'s fear of fire. <entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> confirms the story of his facial scars from burns inflicted by Gregor's wrath and how his father covered up the truth, making him feel alone. Arya offers to clean and stitch him up, and <entidade:Sandor>Sandor</entidade> allows her to.

     
Meanwhile, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick stop at an inn where they are served kidney pie made by none other than <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade>, who proceeds to tell them at length the process in finding the right ingredients. He then asks of <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>'s business, to which she replies that she is in <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> Stark's service to find and protect <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade> leaves after addressing the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> as traitors. As <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick prepare to leave the inn, Podrick reminds <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> that telling people of their quest could be dangerous, but <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>'s honesty is swiftly rewarded when <entidade:Hot Pie>Hot Pie</entidade> approaches and gives them a loaf of bread shaped like a wolf. He tells them that he knows nothing of Sansa, but has seen her sister Arya alive, along with the Hound. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> is surprised because Arya has been presumed dead since she disappeared when her father Ned was executed. They deduce that Arya's captors are probably going to try to ransom Arya somewhere. <entidade:Having>Having</entidade> memorized the complex family trees of the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Houses, Podrick surmises that Arya's aunt <entidade:Lysa Arryn>Lysa Arryn</entidade> is the Hound's only remaining chance of a reward for her. <entidade:Therefore>Therefore</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick decide to head for the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>.

While wandering the <entidade:Eyrie>Eyrie</entidade>'s snow-covered courtyards, Sansa builds a snow replica of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> chances upon her and seems impressed with her efforts. The cousins get along until <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> asks where the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade> is. Sansa tells him <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> doesn't need a <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>. Sansa agrees to add one, but in the process, <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> accidentally knocks over a tower. <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> insists she replicate the tower. <entidade:This>This</entidade> irritates Sansa and <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> throws a tantrum in response. Unable to control her anger, Sansa slaps <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade>. Sansa immediately softens and tries to apologize, but before she can <entidade:Robin>Robin</entidade> threatens to tell his mother and runs away. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> witnesses the action and assures Sansa that he will deal with Lysa, whom he says should discipline her child more often, anyway. Petyr muses on how he should have been Sansa's father, but then tells Sansa that she is more beautiful than her mother Catelyn and kisses Sansa; who is so shocked that she doesn't resist. <entidade:Unknown>Unknown</entidade> to the pair, the kiss is seen by Lysa.

    Lysa is pushed out the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade>.  
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, Sansa is summoned by Lysa, who proceeds to explain the gory details about <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade> executions. Lysa then grabs Sansa and threatens to throw her out for kissing Petyr. She is stopped when Petyr arrives and swears by everything he can think of that he will send Sansa away. Lysa releases Sansa and embraces Petyr, who assures Lysa that he only ever loved one woman - her sister. Lysa has only an instant to contemplate this betrayal, as Petyr shoves her out of the <entidade:Moon Door>Moon Door</entidade> and looks down as she plummets to her death hundreds of feet below.
