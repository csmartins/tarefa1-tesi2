<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> prepares for conflict. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> tries to talk to Theon. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> waits for a sign. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> remains stubborn. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> attempts to reconnect with family.


<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> departs for <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> with <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> and a group of rangers, after speaking with Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> and <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade>. Before they leave, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> gives <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> some of his dragonglass weapons, reminding him of their use against the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>. <entidade:Afterward>Afterward</entidade>, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> visit <entidade:Order of Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade>, who is bedridden and dying from old age. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> brings her baby Little <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> for him to hold and cheer him up a little. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> happily notes that her son has a laugh just like his little brother <entidade:Egg>Egg</entidade> (King <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> V) had when he was a baby. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> a moment of clarity, <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> gravely warns <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> that she and her son must leave the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> while they still can, before winter comes (and the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> with it). Aemon's condition steadily deteriorates during the night, and he fades in and out of consciousness. Near the end he wakes up delirious from a dream, still lost in memory from his youth: he calls out to his brother <entidade:Egg>Egg</entidade>, and says that he had a strange dream that he was an old man. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> passes away soon afterwards.

    <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell</entidade> loses his virginity with <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade>.  
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the courtyard of <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> eulogizes <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> before lighting his funeral pyre, declaring for all to hear that he was the blood of the dragon - "but now his watch is ended." Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> whispers that Sam's friends are abandoning him one by one. <entidade:Afterward>Afterward</entidade>, <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> is attacked in the dining hall by two brothers, but <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> and Jon's direwolf, <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade>, come to her rescue. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> is badly beaten, and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> tends to his injuries. Still in grief at Aemon's death and impressed by <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> defending her, <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> climbs on top of him and they have sex.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> brings food to <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>. She begs him for help, telling him how she has been locked in her bedchamber since her wedding and is visited by <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> every night and he forces himself on her. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> simply tells her to obey <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> or else he would do worse things to her. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> asks what <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> did to <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to break him to such an extent, but he can't bring himself to tell her. He tries to leave but <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> grabs and reminds him that he betrayed her family, making <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> apologize profusely. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> informs him that her family still has allies in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> and tells him to light a candle at the top of the <entidade:Broken Tower>Broken Tower</entidade> which will signal them that she is in danger. When <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> refuses to do it, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> reminds him of his true name, Theon <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>, and makes him promise that he'll help her. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> hesitantly agrees. He trudges through the snow with the candle, up a flight of stairs and into Ramsay’s room.
Later, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is taken to see <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> on the ramparts, which are still under construction. While he is distracted, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> grabs a workman's tool lying on a nearby barrel and pockets it. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> speaks of his thoughts on how they will easily defeat Stannis's army since their soldiers, unlike Stannis's, are trained to fight in the snow, and how he'll one day be the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> and the <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>.
<entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> reminds him of the unborn baby, who, if a boy, will have a stronger claim on the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> since he'll be a true-born. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> tells her that he is <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> Bolton's eldest son, legitimized by the king, who <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> reminds him is another bastard. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> is obviously angered by Sansa's remarks, but doesn't act on it, simply stating that bastards can rise in the world too, informing her of Jon's appointment as <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> then brings up the reason why he summoned her, and shows her the crucified and partly flayed corpse of the old woman who promised to help <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> if she lit a candle in the <entidade:Broken Tower>Broken Tower</entidade>. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> then reveals to <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> that <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, who seems miserable to have squashed Sansa's only hope of an escape, came to him and told him everything. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> chokes back tears as a gleeful <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> orders his men to take her back to her chamber. Meanwhile, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> stares intently at <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> castle from her room in the inn, waiting for the sign to rescue <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>.
Stannis's troops make camp during a violent snowstorm. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> meets with <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and informs him that forty horses died the previous night and more will die come sunset. The <entidade:Stormcrows>Stormcrows</entidade>, a sellsword company, have fled in the night. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> thinks that they should go back to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> and wait out the weather since they do not have enough food, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> stubbornly tells him that they will not retreat to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> because he will not risk being known as "the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> who Ran". As winter will soon arrive, they also run the risk of being stuck at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> for years, during which the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> will regain their strength. Seeing no other way to convince <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> otherwise, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> leaves.
<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> asks <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> if she is sure of their victory at <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> assures him, reminding him that he also saw the vision of his victory in the flames, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is not so sure what he saw anymore. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> reassures him that her visions will come true, but also states that a sacrifice, one with King's blood, must be made in order to ensure their victory, implying that they sacrifice <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is infuriated by the suggestion and orders her to leave.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>
<entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> has <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade> bring <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> to <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> in the quarters where he is confined, as <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is concerned for her safety. Displaying a somewhat more critical mind than her brothers, <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> is suspicious about Jaime's "diplomatic mission" to bring her back to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, to which <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> only replies that there are "complicated matters" involved. <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> flatly refuses to return with him, stating her intent to marry <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade>.
<entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> is singing The Dornishman's Wife in his jail cell, while in the adjoining cell, the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> listen with a mix of annoyance from <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> and <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria</entidade> and amusement from <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade>. After he finishes, the two parties trade barbs, and <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> inquires about Bronn's arm, which she cut with her daggers during their earlier fight, with <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> brushing it off as "a new scar". The two begin to talk about Tyene's beauty, which <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> dismisses until she begins to disrobe. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> stares intently, and begins to change his mind about her. <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> once again inquires about his arm, and then his head, at which point Bronn's nose starts bleeding and his vision blurs.
<entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> collapses and tries to play off his sudden illness, but <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> reveals that her daggers were coated with a slow-acting poison called The <entidade:Long Farewell>Long Farewell</entidade>, and her attempts to seduce <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> were to get his heart pumping faster, thereby allowing the poison to act quicker. She points to an ampoule on her necklace, which contains the antidote, but only offers to give it to <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> on the condition that he agrees that she is the most beautiful woman in the world. Growing weaker, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> barely manages to reply affirmatively, and she tosses the ampoule to a relieved <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>. <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> smiles smugly at him and remarks that she finds him handsome as well, before re-robing and sitting down next to her mildly amused half-sisters.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Septa Unella>Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> meets with the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> to discuss the imprisonment of her grandchildren, Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> and <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade>. Although they briefly bond over the infirmities of age, she demands that he release them and he declines, stating they will be punished for their crimes. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> tells her that the Gods' Laws must be applied to everyone equally. <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> first tries to bribe him, but learning that he cannot be bought, threatens to end the <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> support for the capital by ending shipments of food. Again the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> is unfazed, remarking that the nobility of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> have forgotten they are outnumbered by the common folk and tells <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> to ponder what happens when the many stop fearing the few. Returning to her palanquin, <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> receives a letter bearing <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr</entidade> Baelish's seal.
Meanwhile, in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> rails over his inability to help <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade>. He wants to start a war for <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade>, declaring his love for her to a dumbstruck <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>. To maintain control of the situation, she offers to speak with the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> for him and advocate for <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> and Loras's release. Although clearly suspicious, the still-overwhelmed <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> agrees.
<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> meets with <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> in his ransacked brothel, where they share a tense conversation. <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> reminds him of the role they both played in Joffrey's murder, and that, should her <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> fall, she will have no reason to keep his involvement a secret. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> explains why he returned to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> - he dared not refuse Cersei's summons, and was obliged to give her information. He tells <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> that he will give her the same thing he gave <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>: a handsome young man — implied, in this instance, to be <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade>.
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the Sept's cells, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> meets with <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> and brings her food but <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> refuses, revealing that she knows her mother-in-law is responsible for having her and <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> imprisoned. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, fearful of being overheard, denies this. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> mocks <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her, going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme, she doesn't understand innocence and decency, which <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> suspects is why <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> loves her, <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade>, and was willing to send <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> back to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, concealing her fury, tells <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> her trial will soon begin and that her son needs his mother more than ever. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> throws the stew at <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, and yells at her to get out. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> leaves the cell, smiling smugly at <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade>.
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> her way out, a still gleeful <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> meets with the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> in a chapel that predates the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Septa Unella>Sept</entidade>. The pair briefly discuss the legal process that <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> and <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> will face. As the conversation goes on, however, it's clear that the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> is about to turn the tables on <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>. When <entidade:Brother Lancel>Brother Lancel</entidade> appears, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> realizes what is about to happen, and her triumphant smile begins to crack. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> has an irate <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> taken into custody by a group of Septas who ignore Cersei's threats and lock her in a cell.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>
<entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> is sold by <entidade:Malko>Malko</entidade> to <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> zo <entidade:Qaggaz>Qaggaz</entidade>. Before <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> leaves, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> convinces him that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and he are a team, and is also bought. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> discuss her impending marriage to <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade>. After rejecting his suggestion that she marry him instead, <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> advises her that, on the day the fighting pits are reopened, she should gather all the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade>, <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise</entidade> and Good <entidade:Great Masters>Masters</entidade> and kill them. <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> is reluctant to do so, as she believes it will give her the reputation of a butcher, to which <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> replies that "all rulers are either butchers or meat".
<entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> takes his fighters to <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, to test them in the lower pits and seek out those who are worthy to fight in the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Great Pit>Pit</entidade> of Daznak. They fight in front of a reluctant <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>, as <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> has convinced her that Meereen's ruler occasionally makes the rounds to the lower pits ahead of the main tournament. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> enters the <entidade:Pits>Pits</entidade> early, upon realizing that she is watching and will be repulsed by what she's seeing, and elbows down <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> who tried to berate him. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> easily defeats the other fighters without killing them, impressing <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> enough to prevent her from leaving. When he reveals his identity, however, her face swiftly twists into a scowl and she orders him taken away. Before the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> can comply, <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> declares that he brought her a gift, and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> enters the arena and reveals his identity to the astonished <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade>.
