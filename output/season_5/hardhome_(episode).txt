 In Meereen 
In the <entidade:Throne Room>Throne Room</entidade>, Daenerys ponders on what to do with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and Jorah. She asks <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> why she shouldn't kill him, since the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> are enemies to her House. He claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> as well. Daenerys isn't convinced that killing one's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service. <entidade:Ordered>Ordered</entidade> to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world, he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>. He says that she – a lost girl born in a storm, who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde, an effective army, conquer three cities, break the slave trade and hatch three dragons – might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then. He adds that Daenerys needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons, as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>.
She eventually agrees to spare his life, but asks what to do about Ser Jorah. She seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again, as it would not do at all for a queen not to keep her word. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> defends Jorah, commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her, but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for King Robert and that therefore he cannot be trusted to stand by her side. But, he argues, just as a queen should keep true to her oaths, she should also not kill those devoted to her.
Daenerys exiles Jorah from the city. Contemplating his greyscale, Jorah returns to <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> zo <entidade:Qaggaz>Qaggaz</entidade> and offers to fight for him. He promises to lead <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade>'s team to the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Pit and win the tournament for the Queen – after that <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> can make a fortune selling Jorah on the black market.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and Daenerys sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions. When <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> mentions what a horrible father <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> was, Daenerys admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father. Daenerys is curious about the circumstances of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s murder of <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. He wryly promises that if she decides not to kill him then one day he will tell her, but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from.
They discuss the role of <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> in their stories and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> assures Daenerys he trusts him, and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was convinced by <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> that she could be a ruler who deserves his support. When Daenerys asks how he can get her what she wants, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. He suggests that she might want to stay in Slaver's Bay and build a new kingdom for herself in Meereen, complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage. She assures him that she will stay and help stabilize things, and make sure the slave trade stays broken, but <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade> is not her "home." <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> counters that no one will support her in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, but Daenerys somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> generously assumes that this will happen (which it generally doesn't), but then he reminds Daenerys that Meereen has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Masters and the smallfolk, and extends this to <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> and its <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Houses. He notes that Houses <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> and Stark are effectively dead due to the combined actions of their "two terrible fathers." Neither <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> nor House Baratheon of <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade> will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> says that leaves <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> who might be willing to switch sides due to Cersei's recent schemes against them but that still isn't enough. Daenerys stubbornly likens the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Houses, including her own House <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>, to the spokes on a wheel, one on top and then others, and on and on, crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel, but Daenerys clarifies that she plans to break it.
Daenerys decides <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> will remain as her advisor, but confiscates the wine, as a drunk is of no use to her.

 In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> 
Arya assumes the identity of <entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>, a clam-seller, and shows <entidade:Jaqen H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>'ghar she can convincingly become a different person, developing an elaborate and very believable backstory. The <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Man</entidade> sends her, as <entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>, to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as "the thin man" refuse a contract to insure a man's boat, leaving the man in desperate circumstances. <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> explains the thin man's business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements; when a ship captain dies at sea, he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family, but he often doesn't. <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> instructs her to kill him, and hands her a "gift" for the thin man — a vial of poison. The waif is skeptical of Arya/<entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>'s success.

 In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:Septa <entidade:Septa Unella>Unella</entidade>>Septa <entidade:Septa Unella>Unella</entidade></entidade> continues to urge an imprisoned Cersei to confess in return for her freedom. She remains defiant, despite being obliged to drink water from the floor out of sheer thirst. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> visits her in her cell, and informs her that her trial will begin soon for the crimes of fornication, treason, incest, and Robert's murder, all of which Cersei furiously dismisses as "lies." <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> tells her that Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> has summoned <entidade:Kevan Lannister><entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> Lannister</entidade> to serve as <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King. <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> has, at this point in time, already arrived, and he has refused to visit her in prison. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> also tells her that <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> has become reclusive, refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state. Before leaving, he tells her "the work continues" on their secret project.

 In the North 
A bitter and determined Sansa confronts <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> about his latest betrayal. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> apologetically affirms he was helping her and that there is no escaping Ramsay. He tells her that Theon Greyjoy tried to escape but Ramsay caught him and tortured him until there was no Theon left. Sansa coldly expresses approval and reminds <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> of the role he played in her family's downfall, and that if she could do to him what Ramsay did, she would. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> shamefully admits he deserved his torture as he did terrible things, specifically killing "those boys." Enraged by his dismissive reference seemingly to her brothers as "those boys" rather than <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>, Sansa vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air, forcing <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to finally admit that they were not in fact <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>, only two farm boys. Stunned by this admission, Sansa's anger towards <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone, calling him Theon again, he breaks down and runs out the room, crying, "Not Theon! <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>!"
<entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> maintains that his army must wait inside <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, thus starving out <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>' forces, as <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> had enough supplies to last 6 months under siege. Such conditions would cause a mutiny in the ranks of the Baratheon force and break them down. Ramsay, on the other hand, has a plan to defeat <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> decisively and asks his father to lend him "just 20 good men."

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> continues to tend Sam's wounds. <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> enters with some food, having heard what happened. Once <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> leaves, <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> expresses concern at joining forces with the wildlings, particularly Tormund, who led the raid in which his parents were killed. Sam reassures <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> that Jon knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the Night's Watch nor <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> stands a chance against the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>. Sam explains this is a hard choice Jon had to make, however unpopular, and then tells him not to worry, as Jon always comes back.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> 
<entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> and <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund Giantsbane</entidade>, along with other members of the Night's Watch and the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade>, arrive at the wildling town <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> to convince the rest of the wildlings to join them in the upcoming war against the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> and their armies of Wights.
Insisting on never being an ally with a Crow, The Lord of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade> insults Tormund for being at the side of an enemy like <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>. Tormund seizes the Lord's staff and beats his former ally to death with it. The wildling elders decide to gather in the <entidade:Townshall>Townshall</entidade> to hear out Jon's proposal; an alliance between the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade> and the Night's Watch in the face of their common enemy, the undead.
<entidade:Having>Having</entidade> not seen <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade> since he was taken prisoner at The <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> question his whereabouts. Snow reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally with an arrow. The group is infuriated, but as they move in to kill him, Tormund vouches for him, describing how Rayder was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from <entidade:Stannis Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>, and how Snow defied <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames. Some leaders are convinced, such as <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> and the giant <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, but others like the Thenn warrior <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> begin to leave. Jon offers them the dragonglass daggers, telling them that his friend had killed a White Walker with one. The <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> still seem unconvinced.
While approximately five thousand <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade> gather to set sail to the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, the Night's Watch starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent. Edd approaches <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade> who holds one of the daggers, examining it curiously. The giant appears unwilling to hand it over and asks Edd "The fuck you looking at?" in the giants' rudimentary form of the <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> <entidade:Common Tongue>Tongue</entidade>. Edd walks away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead. Suddenly, dogs begin barking and the sounds of a storm are heard. Recognizing the sign of approaching <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> orders the gates of <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> to be shut, abandoning many of the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade> on the other side to their fate. As the storm reaches the village, the screams of the people shut outside the walls of <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> quickly fall silent. A moment later, a large host of undead wights begin breaking through the gates and climbing over the walls. Jon, Tormund, <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> and <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships. <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison Tollett</entidade>, <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, and others are trapped inside the townhall, which is set upon by wights and catches fire – in the confusion, the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost.

    The <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade> raises the dead wildlings into wights.  
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> top of a hill overlooking <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>, several <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> mounted on undead horses observe the battle, including the <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade>. Noticing them, and realizing the need for dragonglass, Jon and <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> go to the burning townhall, only to be confronted by a White Walker warrior. While <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> faces the threat, <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> goes for the dragonglass. <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the White Walker's ice blade. Jon just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the White Walker. Jon retrieves <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade> and defends himself against the White Walker and both combatants are astonished to see the Valyrian steel remain intact after colliding with the White Walker's blade. Seizing the opportunity, Jon strikes the White Walker, shattering his body into fragments of ice, confirming that Valyrian steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass. The <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade>, watching the entire battle from a distance, seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children. <entidade:Frozen>Frozen</entidade> by the horror, she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death. The <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> deploy another large host of wights, letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. Jon, Edd, Tormund and the remaining defenders flee for their lives. Shielded by <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them, they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance. As Jon and the others look on in horror, the <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade> raises his arms triumphantly; all around it, the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights, including <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade>. The <entidade:Night King>Night King</entidade> and his army continue to stare in silence as they retreat.
