<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> makes progress in her training. Sansa confronts an old friend. Cersei struggles. Jon travels. He convinces the wildlings to fight with the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> but the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers surprise them.

 
 In <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> 
In the <entidade:<entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> Room><entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> Room</entidade>, Daenerys ponders on what to do with <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Jorah. She asks <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> why she shouldn't kill him, since the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> are enemies to her House. He claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> as well. Daenerys isn't convinced that killing one's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service. Ordered to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world, he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>. He says that she – a lost girl born in a storm, who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde, an effective army, conquer three cities, break the slave trade and hatch three dragons – might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then. He adds that Daenerys needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons, as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>.
She eventually agrees to spare his life, but asks what to do about <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade>. She seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again, as it would not do at all for a queen not to keep her word. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> defends Jorah, commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her, but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> and that therefore he cannot be trusted to stand by her side. But, he argues, just as a queen should keep true to her oaths, she should also not kill those devoted to her.
Daenerys exiles Jorah from the city. Contemplating his greyscale, Jorah returns to <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> zo <entidade:Qaggaz>Qaggaz</entidade> and offers to fight for him. He promises to lead <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade>'s team to the Great <entidade:Pit Fighter>Pit</entidade> and win the tournament for the Queen – after that <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> can make a fortune selling Jorah on the black market.
Later, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Daenerys sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions. When <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> mentions what a horrible father <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> was, Daenerys admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father. Daenerys is curious about the circumstances of <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s murder of <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>. He wryly promises that if she decides not to kill him then one day he will tell her, but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from.
They discuss the role of <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> in their stories and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> assures Daenerys he trusts him, and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was convinced by <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> that she could be a ruler who deserves his support. When Daenerys asks how he can get her what she wants, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. He suggests that she might want to stay in <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay and build a new kingdom for herself in <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage. She assures him that she will stay and help stabilize things, and make sure the slave trade stays broken, but <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade> is not her "home." <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> counters that no one will support her in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, but Daenerys somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> generously assumes that this will happen (which it generally doesn't), but then he reminds Daenerys that <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the <entidade:Great Masters>Great Masters</entidade> and the smallfolk, and extends this to <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> and its Great <entidade:Houses Reyne>Houses</entidade>. He notes that <entidade:Houses Reyne>Houses</entidade> Targaryen and Stark are effectively dead due to the combined actions of their "two terrible fathers." Neither <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> nor <entidade:House Baratheon>House Baratheon</entidade> of <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade> will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> says that leaves <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> who might be willing to switch sides due to Cersei's recent schemes against them but that still isn't enough. Daenerys stubbornly likens the Great <entidade:Houses Reyne>Houses</entidade>, including her own <entidade:House Targaryen>House Targaryen</entidade>, to the spokes on a wheel, one on top and then others, and on and on, crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel, but Daenerys clarifies that she plans to break it.
Daenerys decides <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> will remain as her advisor, but confiscates the wine, as a drunk is of no use to her.

 In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> 
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> assumes the identity of <entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>, a clam-seller, and shows <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade> she can convincingly become a different person, developing an elaborate and very believable backstory. The <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Man</entidade> sends her, as <entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>, to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as "the thin man" refuse a contract to insure a man's boat, leaving the man in desperate circumstances. <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> explains the thin man's business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements; when a ship captain dies at sea, he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family, but he often doesn't. <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> instructs her to kill him, and hands her a "gift" for the thin man — a vial of poison. The waif is skeptical of <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>/<entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>'s success.

 In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:Septa Unella>Septa Unella</entidade> continues to urge an imprisoned Cersei to confess in return for her freedom. She remains defiant, despite being obliged to drink water from the floor out of sheer thirst. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> visits her in her cell, and informs her that her trial will begin soon for the crimes of fornication, treason, incest, and <entidade:Robert's>Robert's</entidade> murder, all of which Cersei furiously dismisses as "lies." <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> tells her that Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> has summoned <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan Lannister</entidade> to serve as <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King. Kevan has, at this point in time, already arrived, and he has refused to visit her in prison. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> also tells her that Tommen has become reclusive, refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state. Before leaving, he tells her "the work continues" on their secret project.

 In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
A bitter and determined Sansa confronts <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> about his latest betrayal. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> apologetically affirms he was helping her and that there is no escaping Ramsay. He tells her that <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> tried to escape but Ramsay caught him and tortured him until there was no Theon left. Sansa coldly expresses approval and reminds <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> of the role he played in her family's downfall, and that if she could do to him what Ramsay did, she would. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> shamefully admits he deserved his torture as he did terrible things, specifically killing "those boys." <entidade:Enraged>Enraged</entidade> by his dismissive reference seemingly to her brothers as "those boys" rather than <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>, Sansa vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air, forcing <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to finally admit that they were not in fact <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>, only two farm boys. Stunned by this admission, Sansa's anger towards <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone, calling him Theon again, he breaks down and runs out the room, crying, "Not Theon! <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>!"
Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> maintains that his army must wait inside <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, thus starving out <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' forces, as <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> had enough supplies to last 6 months under siege. Such conditions would cause a mutiny in the ranks of the Baratheon force and break them down. Ramsay, on the other hand, has a plan to defeat <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> decisively and asks his father to lend him "just 20 good men."

 At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> continues to tend <entidade:Sam's>Sam's</entidade> wounds. <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> enters with some food, having heard what happened. Once <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> leaves, <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> expresses concern at joining forces with the wildlings, particularly <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>, who led the raid in which his parents were killed. Sam reassures <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> that Jon knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> nor <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> stands a chance against the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers. Sam explains this is a hard choice Jon had to make, however unpopular, and then tells him not to worry, as Jon always comes back.

 At <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> 
<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane><entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane</entidade>, along with other members of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> and the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade></entidade>, arrive at the wildling town <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> to convince the rest of the wildlings to join them in the upcoming war against the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers and their armies of <entidade:Wights>Wights</entidade>.
Insisting on never being an ally with a <entidade:Crow>Crow</entidade>, The <entidade:Lord of Bones>Lord of Bones</entidade> insults <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> for being at the side of an enemy like <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> seizes the Lord's staff and beats his former ally to death with it. The wildling elders decide to gather in the <entidade:Townshall>Townshall</entidade> to hear out Jon's proposal; an alliance between the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade></entidade> and the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> in the face of their common enemy, the undead.
Having not seen <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade> since he was taken prisoner at The <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> question his whereabouts. <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade> reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally with an arrow. The group is infuriated, but as they move in to kill him, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> vouches for him, describing how Rayder was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon, and how <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade> defied <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames. Some leaders are convinced, such as <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> and the giant <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, but others like the <entidade:Thenn>Thenn</entidade> warrior <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> begin to leave. Jon offers them the dragonglass daggers, telling them that his friend had killed a <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker with one. The <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> still seem unconvinced.
While approximately five thousand <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade></entidade> gather to set sail to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent. Edd approaches <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade> who holds one of the daggers, examining it curiously. The giant appears unwilling to hand it over and asks Edd "The fuck you looking at?" in the giants' rudimentary form of the <entidade:Old Tongue>Old Tongue</entidade>. Edd walks away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead. Suddenly, dogs begin barking and the sounds of a storm are heard. Recognizing the sign of approaching <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers, <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> orders the gates of <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> to be shut, abandoning many of the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade></entidade> on the other side to their fate. As the storm reaches the village, the screams of the people shut outside the walls of <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> quickly fall silent. A moment later, a large host of undead wights begin breaking through the gates and climbing over the walls. Jon, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>, <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> and <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships. <entidade:<entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison</entidade> Tollett><entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison</entidade> Tollett</entidade>, <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, and others are trapped inside the townhall, which is set upon by wights and catches fire – in the confusion, the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost.

    The <entidade:<entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King><entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King</entidade> raises the dead wildlings into wights.  
On top of a hill overlooking <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>, several <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers mounted on undead horses observe the battle, including the <entidade:<entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King><entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King</entidade>. Noticing them, and realizing the need for dragonglass, Jon and <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> go to the burning townhall, only to be confronted by a <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker warrior. While <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> faces the threat, <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> goes for the dragonglass. <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker's ice blade. Jon just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker. Jon retrieves <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade> and defends himself against the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker and both combatants are astonished to see the Valyrian steel remain intact after colliding with the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker's blade. Seizing the opportunity, Jon strikes the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker, shattering his body into fragments of ice, confirming that Valyrian steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass. The <entidade:<entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King><entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King</entidade>, watching the entire battle from a distance, seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children. Frozen by the horror, she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death. The <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers deploy another large host of wights, letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. Jon, Edd, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> and the remaining defenders flee for their lives. Shielded by <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them, they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance. As Jon and the others look on in horror, the <entidade:<entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King><entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King</entidade> raises his arms triumphantly; all around it, the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights, including <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade>. The <entidade:<entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King><entidade:Night King>Night</entidade> King</entidade> and his army continue to stare in silence as they retreat.
