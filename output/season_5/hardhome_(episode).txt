<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> makes progress in her training. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> confronts an old friend. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> struggles. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> travels. He convinces the wildlings to fight with the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> but the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> surprise them.

 
 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> 
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Iron Throne>Throne</entidade> Room, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> ponders on what to do with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>. She asks <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> why she shouldn't kill him, since the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> are enemies to her <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade>. He claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> as well. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> isn't convinced that killing one's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service. <entidade:Ordered>Ordered</entidade> to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world, he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>. He says that she – a lost girl born in a storm, who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde, an effective army, conquer three cities, break the slave trade and hatch three dragons – might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then. He adds that <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons, as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>.
She eventually agrees to spare his life, but asks what to do about Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>. She seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again, as it would not do at all for a queen not to keep her word. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> defends <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>, commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her, but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> and that therefore he cannot be trusted to stand by her side. But, he argues, just as a queen should keep true to her oaths, she should also not kill those devoted to her.
<entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> exiles <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> from the city. Contemplating his greyscale, <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> returns to <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> zo <entidade:Qaggaz>Qaggaz</entidade> and offers to fight for him. He promises to lead Yezzan's team to the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Great Pit>Pit</entidade> and win the tournament for the <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> – after that <entidade:Yezzan>Yezzan</entidade> can make a fortune selling <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> on the black market.
Later, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions. When <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> mentions what a horrible father <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> was, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> is curious about the circumstances of Tyrion's murder of <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. He wryly promises that if she decides not to kill him then one day he will tell her, but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from.
They discuss the role of <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> in their stories and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> assures <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> he trusts him, and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was convinced by <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> that she could be a ruler who deserves his support. When <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> asks how he can get her what she wants, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. He suggests that she might want to stay in Slaver's Bay and build a new kingdom for herself in <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage. She assures him that she will stay and help stabilize things, and make sure the slave trade stays broken, but <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade> is not her "home." <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> counters that no one will support her in <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, but <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> generously assumes that this will happen (which it generally doesn't), but then he reminds <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> that <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Great Masters>Masters</entidade> and the smallfolk, and extends this to <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> and its <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> Houses. He notes that Houses <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> and <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> are effectively dead due to the combined actions of their "two terrible fathers." Neither <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> nor <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> of <entidade:House Baratheon Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade> will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> says that leaves <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> who might be willing to switch sides due to Cersei's recent schemes against them but that still isn't enough. <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> stubbornly likens the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> Houses, including her own <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>, to the spokes on a wheel, one on top and then others, and on and on, crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel, but <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> clarifies that she plans to break it.
<entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> decides <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> will remain as her advisor, but confiscates the wine, as a drunk is of no use to her.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade> 
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> assumes the identity of <entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>, a clam-seller, and shows <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar she can convincingly become a different person, developing an elaborate and very believable backstory. The <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Man</entidade> sends her, as <entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>, to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as "the thin man" refuse a contract to insure a man's boat, leaving the man in desperate circumstances. <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> explains the thin man's business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements; when a ship captain dies at sea, he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family, but he often doesn't. Jaqen instructs her to kill him, and hands her a "gift" for the thin man — a vial of poison. The waif is skeptical of Arya/Lanna's success.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> 
<entidade:Septa Unella>Septa Unella</entidade> continues to urge an imprisoned <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> to confess in return for her freedom. She remains defiant, despite being obliged to drink water from the floor out of sheer thirst. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> visits her in her cell, and informs her that her trial will begin soon for the crimes of fornication, treason, incest, and Robert's murder, all of which <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> furiously dismisses as "lies." <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> tells her that Grand <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> has summoned <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan Lannister</entidade> to serve as <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>. <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> has, at this point in time, already arrived, and he has refused to visit her in prison. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> also tells her that <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> has become reclusive, refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state. Before leaving, he tells her "the work continues" on their secret project.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
A bitter and determined <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> confronts <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> about his latest betrayal. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> apologetically affirms he was helping her and that there is no escaping <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade>. He tells her that Theon <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> tried to escape but <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> caught him and tortured him until there was no Theon left. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> coldly expresses approval and reminds <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> of the role he played in her family's downfall, and that if she could do to him what <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> did, she would. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> shamefully admits he deserved his torture as he did terrible things, specifically killing "those boys." Enraged by his dismissive reference seemingly to her brothers as "those boys" rather than <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air, forcing <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to finally admit that they were not in fact <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>, only two farm boys. Stunned by this admission, Sansa's anger towards <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone, calling him Theon again, he breaks down and runs out the room, crying, "Not Theon! <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>!"
<entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> maintains that his army must wait inside <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, thus starving out Stannis' forces, as <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> had enough supplies to last 6 months under siege. Such conditions would cause a mutiny in the ranks of the <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> force and break them down. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade>, on the other hand, has a plan to defeat <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> decisively and asks his father to lend him "just 20 good men."

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> 
<entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> continues to tend Sam's wounds. Olly enters with some food, having heard what happened. Once <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> leaves, <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> expresses concern at joining forces with the wildlings, particularly <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>, who led the raid in which his parents were killed. Sam reassures <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> nor <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> stands a chance against the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> explains this is a hard choice <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> had to make, however unpopular, and then tells him not to worry, as <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> always comes back.

 <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> 
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> and Tormund Giantsbane, along with other members of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> and the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade>, arrive at the wildling town <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> to convince the rest of the wildlings to join them in the upcoming war against the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> and their armies of Wights.
Insisting on never being an ally with a <entidade:Crown>Crow</entidade>, The <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade> insults <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> for being at the side of an enemy like <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> seizes the Lord's staff and beats his former ally to death with it. The wildling elders decide to gather in the <entidade:Townshall>Townshall</entidade> to hear out Jon's proposal; an alliance between the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade> and the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> in the face of their common enemy, the undead.
<entidade:Having>Having</entidade> not seen <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade> since he was taken prisoner at The <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> question his whereabouts. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally with an arrow. The group is infuriated, but as they move in to kill him, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> vouches for him, describing how <entidade:Mance Rayder>Rayder</entidade> was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>, and how <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> defied <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames. Some leaders are convinced, such as <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> and the giant <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, but others like the Thenn warrior <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> begin to leave. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> offers them the dragonglass daggers, telling them that his friend had killed a <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade> with one. The <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> still seem unconvinced.
While approximately five thousand <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade> gather to set sail to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent. <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> approaches <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade> who holds one of the daggers, examining it curiously. The giant appears unwilling to hand it over and asks <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> "The fuck you looking at?" in the giants' rudimentary form of the <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> <entidade:Common Tongue>Tongue</entidade>. <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade> walks away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead. Suddenly, dogs begin barking and the sounds of a storm are heard. Recognizing the sign of approaching <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> orders the gates of <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> to be shut, abandoning many of the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade> on the other side to their fate. As the storm reaches the village, the screams of the people shut outside the walls of <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> quickly fall silent. A moment later, a large host of undead wights begin breaking through the gates and climbing over the walls. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>, <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> and <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships. <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Eddison Tollett</entidade>, <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, and others are trapped inside the townhall, which is set upon by wights and catches fire – in the confusion, the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost.

    The <entidade:Night Watch>Night</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> raises the dead wildlings into wights.  
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> top of a hill overlooking <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>, several <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> mounted on undead horses observe the battle, including the <entidade:Night Watch>Night</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>. Noticing them, and realizing the need for dragonglass, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> go to the burning townhall, only to be confronted by a <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade> warrior. While <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> faces the threat, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> goes for the dragonglass. <entidade:Loboda>Loboda</entidade> is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> Walker's ice blade. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> retrieves <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade> and defends himself against the <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade> and both combatants are astonished to see the <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> steel remain intact after colliding with the <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> Walker's blade. Seizing the opportunity, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> strikes the <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade>, shattering his body into fragments of ice, confirming that <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass. The <entidade:Night Watch>Night</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>, watching the entire battle from a distance, seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade> fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children. <entidade:Frozen>Frozen</entidade> by the horror, she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death. The <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> deploy another large host of wights, letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>, <entidade:Eddison Tollett>Edd</entidade>, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> and the remaining defenders flee for their lives. Shielded by <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>, who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them, they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance. As <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and the others look on in horror, the <entidade:Night Watch>Night</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> raises his arms triumphantly; all around it, the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights, including <entidade:Karsi>Karsi</entidade>. The <entidade:Night Watch>Night</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> and his army continue to stare in silence as they retreat.
