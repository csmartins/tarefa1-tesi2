The <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> grow increasingly aggressive; <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> head south; <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> and the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> vow vengeance.


<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> a <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> meeting, Master of Coin <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace Tyrell</entidade> brings bad news that the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Iron Bank>Bank</entidade> of <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade> is starting to call in its debts from <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. They have started by calling in a tenth of the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron</entidade> Throne's current debts to the bank, which it can only afford half of as rebuilding the <entidade:Royal Fleet>Royal Fleet</entidade> was also a massive expense. <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> offers that <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> could front the money for the time being, but <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> clearly does not want to give the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> more power over the crown. Instead, she says that they will send <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> himself to <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade> to negotiate for more time, because sending such a high-ranking official will show the bank how seriously they take their large debts. <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> is oblivious that this is also Cersei's way of removing him from the capital, and takes it as a high honor - as well as that <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> will send Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> along to "guard" him. After he leaves, <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> bitterly points out that the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> is growing even smaller (the only three members left in the capital are <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade>, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, and her lackey Qyburn), but she says it hasn't quite grown small enough yet.

    <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> meets with the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade>.  
<entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> then meets with the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade>, who by her influence, has been elected as the new <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> of the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven</entidade>. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is trying to build up a new alliance between the <entidade:Crown>Crown</entidade> and the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade>, as a counterweight against the large political influence the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> now possess. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> points out to the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> that the <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>War</entidade> of the Five Kings has devastated much of the countryside, resulting in septs being burned, clergymen attacked, and even <entidade:Silent Sisters>Silent Sisters</entidade> raped. Bodies of holy men are piling up in the streets. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> admits that wars make men obey the sword more than the gods. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> points out that before the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade>, the military order known as the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> dispensed the justice of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven</entidade>. The <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> is confused, as the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> disbanded the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> over two centuries ago. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> explains that, as part of the new alliance she hopes to build between the <entidade:Crown>Crown</entidade> and the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade>, she will tell her son to repeal the law and allow the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> to be reestablished and re-armed: an army whose purpose is to defend the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade>, holy men, and the smallfolk - and which will incidentally be turned against the Crown's enemies. She then advises him that there is a great sinner in their midst who has been shielded by gold and power. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> replies with a wish for The <entidade:Farther>Father</entidade> to judge him justly.
The new <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> storm the streets of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, attacking taverns, brothels, and street vendors selling idols from other religions. The <entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> look on, helpless, and do not intervene. They ransack Littlefinger's brothel, dragging prostitutes like <entidade:Marei>Marei</entidade> out into the street by their hair. <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> is struck and ignored as they barge in; he then sees that in another room they have singled out a man having sex with one of the male prostitutes, and approach him with a knife. <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> flees.

    <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> attempts to have his brother-in-law <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> released, but fails.  
As a sign of their zealotry, the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> have the Seven-Pointed <entidade:Benjen Stark>Star</entidade> symbol of the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> carved into their foreheads - including <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade>, who leads a squad of the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> to apprehend <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> while he is sparring in the practice yard. <entidade:Brother Lancel>Lancel</entidade> proclaims that Loras' sexual perversions are sins against the laws of gods and men, and <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> is dragged off. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> is furious at <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> for her brother's arrest, then tries to manipulate him by weeping at how hurt she is that he let this happen to <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>. <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> then goes to his mother and, briefly standing up to her, demands that <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> be released at once. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> calmly points out that she didn't arrest <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>, the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> simply dragged him off and imprisoned him, so he should ask the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> to release him. <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> naively thinks the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> will simply do as he requests, so he heads to the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Septa Unella>Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> with five <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> and several <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> guards. The path to the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Septa Unella>Sept</entidade> is blocked by the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade>, who say that the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> is praying and does not wish to be disturbed. The <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> request that <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> let them kill the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> to pass. <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> is surprised at this and does not want to risk bloodshed escalating matters - particularly, shedding blood on holy ground. Unsure of what to do, the mob of commoners behind him starts shouting that he is really a bastard and an abomination of incest. Realizing this is not going to end well, <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> meekly withdraws back to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> is even more upset at how ineffectual young <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> was, so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> back to the capital to deal with this.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>
<entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> and Ser <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> are on a <entidade:Pentos>Pentoshi</entidade> merchant ship, which is headed to <entidade:Oldtown>Oldtown</entidade> in the <entidade:Reach>Reach</entidade>. They sail past <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade>, off the coast of the <entidade:Stormlands>Stormlands</entidade>, which <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> mistakenly identifies as Estermont. The captain corrects him, stating that they are sailing through the <entidade:Sapphire Isle>Sapphire Isle</entidade>, which reminds him of <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade>. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> explains to <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> that he bribed the captain to let them take a small boat to shore as they pass <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, and they will land just outside of <entidade:Sunspear>Sunspear</entidade> and the adjacent <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade>. Below decks, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> remarks on why <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> must want to go and protect Princess <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> for himself: he's the one who let <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> escape, and he hopes this will make up for that. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> curtly says that <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> did (when in fact, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> forced <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> to help him free Tyrion). <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> says that if <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> ever sees <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> again <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> should give him his regards; <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> angrily says that if he sees his brother again, he's going to split him in two for murdering their father <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>.

    <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> uses his metal hand to stop a blade.  
<entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> rows the pair ashore at dusk, though <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> can't help row with his one hand. When they awake the next morning <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> kills a snake that was near Jaime's head and roasts it up for breakfast. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> is worried that the ship's captain will subsequently spread word that a <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> is in Dorne; <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> says he bribed him with a large bag of gold, but <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> still worries. A mounted patrol soon comes by, however, and sees their tracks in the sand. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> present themselves and try to pass off that they are simple travelers and their boat capsized in the night, but the ruse doesn't work, and the sentries demand that they drop their weapons so they can be taken prisoner and their identities confirmed. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> plants his sword in the sand - then quickly throws his dagger in the lead sentry's throat. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> draw their swords and fight the rest. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> can't fight very well left-handed so <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> kills one sentry's horse in order for <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> to fight him on foot. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is being overpowered but catches the sentry's sword with his metal hand at the last moment. He then uses the distraction to land a killing blow to the sentry with his left hand. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, having finished off the other sentries, notes that they now have their horses: fine <entidade:Dornish Lords>Dornish</entidade> sand steeds, capable of running a day and a night without tiring. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> says the bodies need to be buried so they won't raise more questions. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> says it will take a lot of time to dig holes for them all, though <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> again points out that he can't really do much digging with one hand. <entidade:Annoyed>Annoyed</entidade>, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> then drags off the bodies to bury.

    The <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> torture a merchant ship captain.  
Meanwhile, elsewhere outside of <entidade:Sunspear>Sunspear</entidade>, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade> meets with three of the eight <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade>, her lover <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> Martell's bastard daughters. <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara Sand</entidade>, the eldest, is the daughter of a peasant; <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria Sand</entidade> (commonly called "Nym") is the daughter of an eastern noblewoman; the youngest of the three, <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene Sand</entidade>, is Ellaria's own daughter. She informs them that <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade> will not raise Dorne's armies to avenge his brother's death. They worry that they have no army to march against the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, but <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> tells them that they don't need one: to start a war, all they need to do is kill Cersei's daughter <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade>, currently in Doran's possession.
<entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> then points out that they may have a problem. The <entidade:Pentos>Pentoshi</entidade> ship captain found her in <entidade:Planky Town>Planky Town</entidade>, and as <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> feared, he indeed tried to sell her information about <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> Lannister's arrival in <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>. The <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade>, however, were insulted that he wanted to be paid for such vital information instead of offering it freely, so they took him prisoner and tortured it out of him. <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria</entidade> uses her whip to knock a bucket over, and reveals underneath that they buried the ship's captain neck-deep in the sand, with his head under a bucket full of poisonous scorpions. They realize that they are now in a race against time to see who can take <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> from <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> first: <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> or themselves. <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> asks if the three girls are with her, knowing this will bring <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> into war. <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria</entidade> and <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> say yes. <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> notes that when she first met <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>, he was a man whom she had never met who one day appeared, said he was her father, and that he was taking her away from her mother. Her mother wept, but <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> said that, "we all must choose our battles and the gods let us choose our weapons." He threw his spear at her feet, pointed to her mother's tears, then to his spear, and told her to choose. She chose the spear - and answers <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> that she is with her, as she chose the path of the spear and war long ago. She then throws her spear to impale the ship captain's head.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Free Cities>Free Cities</entidade>
    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is held captive by <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>.  
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Bridge Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, during the night, <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> knocks out a fisherman and steals his boat, leaving with his captive <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade>. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> when they are at sea, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> urges for <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> to remove his gag. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> will not volunteer any information about himself, but from a few observations (such as the bear sigil on his armor), <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> quickly surmises that he must be <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade>. He admits to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that the "Queen" he is taking him to is not <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> but <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> recalls from <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> meetings that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> was spying on <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> for <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>. Given that he is half the world away from <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>, he also accurately deduces that she must have found out he was spying on her and had him exiled - and therefore, he kidnapped <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> in the hope that presenting him as a gift to <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> will get him back in her favor. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> laughs aloud at his situation, informing <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> that he was already heading to meet <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>, so this is a waste of a kidnapping. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> also points out that there is no guarantee this will assuage <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>, and it is just as likely she will remain angry at <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>, and welcome himself as an ally. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> smacks <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> across the face, quieting him down.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> seduces <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>.  
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> trains recruits in the practice yard of <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, as <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> and his wife <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> watch, along with their daughter <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>. <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> is worried that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> wishes <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> was his son, because she gave him only stillbirths and weakness, but he says that wasn't her fault. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> joins them and appears to quite firmly take Stannis's side, declaring that the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> doesn't care about Shireen's <entidade:Shireen Greyscale>Greyscale</entidade> disfigurement, and this doesn't change the fact that she has her father's blood. When <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> departs, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> discusses the coming battle to take <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> from the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>. She asks if <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> intends to leave her behind as he did at the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> assures her he won't this time.
As the new <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade>, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> goes over paperwork with <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade>, letters they have received from minor Houses offering up a handful of new recruits. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> balks when <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell</entidade> hands him a request letter for <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>, saying he killed his brother <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> points out that <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> is now the <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, and he has the most recruits to send them - much more than the pittances offered by the other minor Houses <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> has never even heard of. He reminds <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> has sworn an oath of political neutrality. With disgust, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> reluctantly signs the letter to the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>.
As <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> departs, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> enters. She entreats him to assist <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> in retaking <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, pointing out that even if he doesn't become a <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, his familiarity with the castle could win them the battle. She also acknowledges that there is a greater war at stake, and asks <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> if he is on the side of life or death, undoing her dress and straddling him as she does so. She encourages <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> to take her, as the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> made humans male and female for a reason; although clearly tempted, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> refuses, citing his vows, and the fact that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> wouldn't approve (to which <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> suggests they not tell him). When <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> points out that he broke his vows once before, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> acknowledges that he still feels for his deceased love. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> adjusts her dress and leaves, but not before uttering the words the new <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> thought he'd never hear again: "You know nothing, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>."
Later, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is in his chambers at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> working on other letters, and <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> enters. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> begins to apologise for dragging her along on campaign with him, as <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> is hardly a place for a child, but <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> cuts him off; she is happy to have come, having expected to be left at <entidade:House Baratheon Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, as <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> had made it clear she wanted. <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> asks her father if he is ashamed of her because of her deformity; <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> gets up from his table and explains that not long after <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> was born, a <entidade:Dornish Lords>Dornish</entidade> trader arrived on <entidade:House Baratheon Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade> and, having heard of Shireen's birth, gave a wooden doll as a gift for the newborn girl. Unfortunately, the doll was contaminated with greyscale, and by the time that was discovered, <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> had already contracted the disease. Everyone claimed <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> would die of it sooner or later, and urged <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> to send her to the ruins of Valyria to live out her days with the "Stone Men" before the disease infected the rest of the castle; <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer, apothecary and <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> he could to save <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> insists that <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> is his daughter and he would not send her away because she belonged with her family. <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>, overjoyed at her father's declaration, runs over and gives him a hug which, after an awkward pause, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> returns.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
    <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> visits the tombs of her family.  
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> takes the opportunity to visit her family's underground crypts. She comes to the tomb and statue of her aunt <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> (and finds the feather token that <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> left there years ago when he visited the castle). <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> arrives and says he thought he'd find her there. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> remarks that her father, <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, never talked about <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade>, but she would at times find him down in the crypts lighting candles at her tomb. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> never knew <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> because she died before she was born, but she notes that people say she was beautiful.
<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> says that he actually saw <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> once years ago, and she was as beautiful as everyone says. <entidade:Sack>Back</entidade> when he was a boy living with Sansa's mother's family, the old <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> Whent of <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> held a massive tournament: every notable figure of the time came from across <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>: the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>, <entidade:Crown>Crown</entidade> <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar Targaryen</entidade>, <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>, <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, everyone. <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> had already been publicly betrothed to <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> at the time. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> remembers how awed he was, a boy from nowhere and with no significant holdings, to see all of these living legends gathered in one place. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the final tilt, <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> rode against Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade>. <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> won and the entire crowd erupted in cheers - only to suddenly drop dead silent when <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> rode right past his wife, <entidade:Elia Martell>Elia Martell</entidade>, to lay the victor's crown (made of blue winter roses) in Lyanna's lap. Not long afterwards, <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> made off with <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade>, sparking off Robert's Rebellion which overthrew the <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> dynasty. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> wonders how many thousands died because <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> chose <entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> - to which <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> says that he chose her, then kidnapped and raped her. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> gives her a wry look and moves on to another part of the crypts.
<entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> notices that <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> is wearing riding clothes, and he explains that he is heading back to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, because <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> sent a letter requesting his presence and it would be best not to make her suspicious by refusing to come. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> will be alone with the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> but he explains his plan to her: <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> will have to attack the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> soon if he is to beat the winter snows, and he bets that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> will probably win, because he is one of the best military commanders in all of <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, and the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> will be outnumbered by <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, as the other northern houses would be quick to betray their liege lord. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> will then make <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> the new ruler of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, as the last (known) surviving <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> heir and in memory of her father Eddard's support for <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> asks what will happen on the off chance that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> gets killed, and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> explains that marrying <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> now will at least leave <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> in a position to insinuate herself among the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> and help destroy them from within in future plans. Either way, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> will be Littlefinger's powerful "ally" in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> kisses <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> on the lips, and departs.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>
    <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> speaks with Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade>.  
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> Pyramid, and Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> also brings up <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar Targaryen</entidade>. He says that the city's inhabitants always seem happy from such a distance, but <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> actually liked to leave the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> and mingle with the common people on the streets. <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> accompanied him often to guard him, and says that <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> liked to sing to people. He was a great singer, so he would find a place on one of the streets just like any public minstrel and sing. He liked to see how much money he could make, and everyone enjoyed his singing, so he often made quite a lot. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is surprised, because her brother <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> only told her that <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> was a great killer. 

    An injured <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> continues to fight the <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade>.  
<entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> scoffs that <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> was a great warrior but never enjoyed killing, he was a gentle man who enjoyed singing. She asks what they did with all the money, and <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> says that they did all sorts of things: sometimes they just gave it to the next minstrel on the road, once <entidade:Rhaegar Targaryen>Rhaegar</entidade> gave it all to an orphanage in the slums of <entidade:Flea Bottom>Flea Bottom</entidade>, and one time they spent it to get horribly drunk. <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade> then comes to say that the day's supplicants are waiting in the throne room, chief among them <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade>. <entidade:Aware>Aware</entidade> of his dislike of politics, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> asks if <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> wants to attend her in the throne room; after being assured that <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> has her back, she gives him the day off, cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below.
<entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> again beseeches <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> to reopen the fighting pits of <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting season. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> again refuses, but <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> rationally argues that the fighting pits provide a great spectacle that has always been enjoyed by both the slave-masters and slaves, and is one of the few things that can bring the city together. Bringing back this major tradition will not instantly solve all of her problems, he concedes, but it would be a start at mending together her subjects.

    <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> runs towards danger.  
As he speaks, the <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade> are already mounting a series of large-scale attacks in the streets. A <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereenese</entidade> prostitute helps them distract and kill some of the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>, and when a patrol of <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> arrives, she feigns fear and directs them into a trap by pointing that the <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade> ran into a narrow alleyway. The <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> give chase, only to be surrounded by a much larger number of the <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade>. <entidade:Brutal>Brutal</entidade> fighting rages throughout the streets of <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> is among the ambushed Unsullied; he kills many attackers, though he loses his helmet, is slashed in the leg, and is stabbed in his side. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> pulls the dagger out of himself, stabs a foe in the throat with it, and keeps fighting, though his wounds slow him considerably. Most of the <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade> are dead but they outnumber the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> so much to begin with that only <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> is left. Just then, Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> arrives and saves <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> by drawing the attention of the remaining rebels. He takes on eight <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade> and defeats them all, save for the last one, who stabs him in the belly. He falls to his knees and just as his attacker is about to slit his throat, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> takes him out by shoving his spear into his back. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> staggers over <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade>, but he has lost consciousness. Severely wounded, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> then slumps down to the floor next to him.
