In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, Arya sees the Many-Faced <entidade:Drowned God>God</entidade>. In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, Queen Margaery enjoys her new husband. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> walk the <entidade:Long Bridge>Long Bridge</entidade> of Volantis.


In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
    <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> and Margaery are wed.  As <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> passes a large crowd on her way to the <entidade:Great Sept><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, she is increasingly annoyed as people cheer on Margaery, completely ignoring her. <entidade:Tommen Baratheon><entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> and <entidade:Margaery Tyrell>Margaery Tyrell</entidade> are wed, much to the dismay of Cersei. That night, they consummate their marriage. They are elated and discuss their future together. <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> thinks that his mother is unhappy in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. Seeing an opportunity, Margaery manipulates <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> into thinking that as long as Cersei stays in King’s <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, she will continue to treat him like a child, watching over him. The next morning, <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> and Cersei are out for a walk. <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> tells his mother that he thinks she should return to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade> if it will make her happy, since she used to talk so fondly of it, but Cersei declines. Deducing that this is Margaery’s doing, Cersei pays her a visit, to find Margaery busy gloating about her “exhausting” night with the King. Greeting her mother-in-law, Margaery now more confident than ever, subtly rubs her queenship in Cersei’s face. Seeing herself losing, Cersei walks away.
In <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s brothel, the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> attack the <entidade:High <entidade:High Septon>Septon</entidade>>High <entidade:High Septon>Septon</entidade></entidade> as he engages the services of prostitutes dressed as the Seven. He is forced to walk naked through the streets while the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> proclaim him a sinner. <entidade:Angered>Angered</entidade> by the humiliation, he wants the <entidade:Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade>>Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade></entidade> to arrest the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> and execute their leader, the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade>. Although unsympathetic, Cersei decides to meet with the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade>, who turns out to be a humble man serving food to the poor, barefoot. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> makes no efforts to hide the actions of the other <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade>. Cersei tells him that he will not be arrested or executed, and that the <entidade:High <entidade:High Septon>Septon</entidade>>High <entidade:High Septon>Septon</entidade></entidade> has been imprisoned instead, which surprises the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade>. Returning to the <entidade:Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>>Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade></entidade>, Cersei has <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> send a message to <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade>. As <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> writes, behind him, the body of <entidade:Gregor Clegane><entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor</entidade> Clegane</entidade> begins shaking under the sheet, but <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> shushes him calmly.

In the North
While being served lunch by <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> scolds Ramsay on his recent flaying of Lord Cerwyn and his family on what was supposed to be a routine tax collection. Ramsay points out that he eventually got the taxes, but <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> reminds his son that terror cannot sustain their hold on the North and that they are outnumbered if the other houses rise up in rebellion. With <entidade:Tywin Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>'s death, the pact between the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> and the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> is effectively dead. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> then declares that the best way to cement <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> control of the North is through marriage.
<entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> is horrified to see <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade>. There is only one reason Baelish could be taking her there - he means to return her to <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, straight into the arms of the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>. Recalling their earlier discussion of a marriage proposal, Sansa realizes that the proposal is not for him, but for her, and furiously declares that she would rather die than marry <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> corrects her and clarifies that she will be marrying Ramsay <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>, then calms her down by convincing her that nobody will look for her there, and suggesting that this is her best opportunity for revenge. Sansa reluctantly agrees.

    The <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> greet Sansa and Baelish  <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> itself, the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> and their households greet Sansa and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>. After a tense moment, Sansa graciously accepts <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade>'s welcome, putting on an air of politeness that protected her in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, while from afar, Ramsay's bedwarmer and secret lover, <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>, observes with jealousy and anger. Sansa is later shown to her old room, seemingly foreign to her after all this time. To her surprise, the servant attending her welcomes her back and quietly assures her that, "the North remembers." <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, as Sansa explores the castle, <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> hides his face from her, but seems to have difficulty forcing himself not to call out to her.
Elsewhere in the castle, Baelish subtly warns Ramsay against inflicting any harm on Sansa, and discusses the situation with <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade>, who is suspicious of <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s motives in betraying the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>. Baelish points out that <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is dead, Jaime is one-handed and politically useless, and that Cersei is about to be forced into the background by Margaery, who is quite fond of Sansa. <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>, nevertheless, demands to read any messages <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> might send off back to the <entidade:Capital>Capital</entidade>.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>
King <entidade:Stannis Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> tries unsuccessfully to convince the new Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the Night's Watch, <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>, to accept his offer of legitimization. Jon declines <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s offer and reiterates that his place is with the Night's Watch. Jon also reiterates the Night's Watch's neutrality in the affairs of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> and asks <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> when he plans to leave; <entidade:Battle <entidade:Castle Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:Castle Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>'s stores are insufficient to feed the Night's Watch, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s army, and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> confirms that his army will leave soon enough to confront the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> at <entidade:Winterfell><entidade:Battle Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> before the winter snows trap them at the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>. He leaves the fate of the wildling prisoners in Jon's hands, allowing Jon to decide whether to execute them or to see if Tormund is more willing to negotiate than Mance. When <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> suggests appointing <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> as the new commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Jon retorts that "it is better to have your enemies close by than far away." As <entidade:Davos Seaworth><entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth</entidade> prepares to leave with his liege, he invites Jon to ponder on the second-to-last stanza on the Night's Watch oath: "I am the shield that guards the realms of men." He also assures Jon that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s leadership advice is offered because the king has taken a liking to him.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, at the mess hall, Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> asks Sam about <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> and it is learned his health is waning and entrusts his care in Sam's hands. Jon begins assigning roles to members of the Watch. He assigns one black brother to oversee the digging of a new latrine pit to accommodate the wildling prisoners. Snow also shows respect to Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> by appointing him as the new <entidade:First Ranger>First Ranger</entidade>, commending his experience. Finally, Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> Snow assigns <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade> with the task of restoring and manning the abandoned castle <entidade:Greyguard>Greyguard</entidade>. Slynt refuses Jon not once, but three times. Even after being warned that he is disobeying a direct order, he flippantly tells Jon that he can take his order and 'shove it up his bastard arse.' <entidade:Having>Having</entidade> publicly disobeyed and insulted Jon, the Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> orders Janos taken outside, and calls for <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> to fetch him his sword. Ser Alliser briefly hesitates but then moves out of the way to let <entidade:Dolorous Edd>Dolorous Edd</entidade> and others grab Slynt, who angrily protests that he has important friends at court and dismisses the matter as a scare tactic.

    Small justice for <entidade:Ned Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade>.  
Jon has Janos dragged out into the courtyard where, obedient to the laws of his father <entidade:Eddard Stark><entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> Stark</entidade> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - he prepares to publicly behead him for treason. Slynt's bluster is lost, and the man who once took a baby girl from her mother's arms and killed her starts crying and begging for mercy, saying he will do whatever Jon asks and that he is afraid. Jon hesitates for a moment, but then fixes his nerve and executes the cowardly former <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:City Watch><entidade:City Watch>City</entidade> Watch</entidade> with a single swing of his sword - incidentally exacting small justice on one of the men who betrayed his own father to his death and murdered <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade>'s children. From across the courtyard, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> sees Jon behead Janos for refusing his orders, and slightly nods in approval.

In the <entidade:Free Cities>Free Cities</entidade>
    Arya is accosted by The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>  In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade> has been put to work cleaning the main sanctuary of the House of Black and White. She watches as <entidade:Jaqen H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>'ghar assists a supplicant in drinking from the temple's well. She protests to <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> that she wants to learn, but he brushes off her discontent. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> on, Arya is accosted in her room by The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>, who repeatedly asks her who she is, hitting her when she gives the expected response of "no one." <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> eventually arrives and demands to know what is going on, as the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> has overstepped her bounds. He does, however, point out that Arya cannot be no one, as she is wearing <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade>'s clothes, is in possession of silver stolen by <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade>, and was about to attack the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> using <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade>'s sword. Realizing his point, Arya binds her old clothing to a rock and tosses it into the lagoon along with the stolen silver. She cannot bring herself to discard <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> so easily, and instead hides it within a sea wall nearby. Back at the House, <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> allows Arya to progress to an inner chamber where she is to assist the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> in stripping and washing corpses. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> is silent when Arya asks what happens to the bodies after they are cleaned.
    The <entidade:Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade>  
Meanwhile, further south in the <entidade:Free Cities>Free Cities</entidade>, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> finally arrive at Volantis. Sick of the carriage they've been riding in, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> again dismisses the dangers and insists they leave to explore. The pair move through the <entidade:Long Bridge>Long Bridge</entidade>'s markets, where <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> explains the meaning of the various tattoos <entidade:Volantene>Volantene</entidade> slaves must sport. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> nearly loses <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, but finds him observing the sermon of a <entidade:Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> claims curiosity, since <entidade:Thoros>Thoros</entidade> of Myr was the only <entidade:Red Priest>Red Priest</entidade> in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. The <entidade:Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade> evangelizes in <entidade:High Valyrian>High Valyrian</entidade>, telling the tale of how she was once a slave herself. Like another <entidade:Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>>Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade></entidade>, she preaches of a prophesied savior, a <entidade:Dragon Queen>Dragon Queen</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s interest in the scene wanes when the <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade> halts in her sermon and stares directly into his eyes.
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> next leads <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> to a brothel. Catching sight of a prostitute dressed as Daenerys, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> tells <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> woos a dark-haired prostitute, but when she finally agrees to service him, he finds that he can't bring himself to patronize her. He then goes to urinate off the side of the bridge, with <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> losing sight of him. As <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> finishes, he is abducted by <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade>, who declares that he is taking him to "the queen."
