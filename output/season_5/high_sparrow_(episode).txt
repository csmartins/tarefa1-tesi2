In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> sees the <entidade:Many-Faced God>Many-Faced God</entidade>. In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Queen Margaery>Queen Margaery</entidade> enjoys her new husband. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> walk the <entidade:Long Bridge>Long Bridge</entidade> of <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>.


In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
    Tommen and Margaery are wed.  As <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> passes a large crowd on her way to the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, she is increasingly annoyed as people cheer on Margaery, completely ignoring her. <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen Baratheon</entidade> and <entidade:Margaery Tyrell>Margaery Tyrell</entidade> are wed, much to the dismay of Cersei. That night, they consummate their marriage. They are elated and discuss their future together. Tommen thinks that his mother is unhappy in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. Seeing an opportunity, Margaery manipulates Tommen into thinking that as long as Cersei stays in <entidade:King’s Landing>King’s Landing</entidade>, she will continue to treat him like a child, watching over him. The next morning, Tommen and Cersei are out for a walk. Tommen tells his mother that he thinks she should return to <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade> if it will make her happy, since she used to talk so fondly of it, but Cersei declines. Deducing that this is <entidade:Margaery’s>Margaery’s</entidade> doing, Cersei pays her a visit, to find Margaery busy gloating about her “exhausting” night with the King. Greeting her mother-in-law, Margaery now more confident than ever, subtly rubs her queenship in <entidade:Cersei’s>Cersei’s</entidade> face. Seeing herself losing, Cersei walks away.
In <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s brothel, the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> attack the <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> as he engages the services of prostitutes dressed as the Seven. He is forced to walk naked through the streets while the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> proclaim him a sinner. <entidade:Angered>Angered</entidade> by the humiliation, he wants the Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade> to arrest the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade> and execute their leader, the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade>. Although unsympathetic, Cersei decides to meet with the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade>, who turns out to be a humble man serving food to the poor, barefoot. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> makes no efforts to hide the actions of the other <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade>. Cersei tells him that he will not be arrested or executed, and that the <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> has been imprisoned instead, which surprises the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade>. Returning to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, Cersei has <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> send a message to <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> Baelish. As <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> writes, behind him, the body of <entidade:Gregor Clegane>Gregor Clegane</entidade> begins shaking under the sheet, but <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> shushes him calmly.

In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
While being served lunch by <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> scolds Ramsay on his recent flaying of <entidade:Lord Cerwyn>Lord Cerwyn</entidade> and his family on what was supposed to be a routine tax collection. Ramsay points out that he eventually got the taxes, but Roose reminds his son that terror cannot sustain their hold on the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> and that they are outnumbered if the other houses rise up in rebellion. With <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade>'s death, the pact between the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> and the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> is effectively dead. Roose then declares that the best way to cement <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> control of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> is through marriage.
<entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> is horrified to see <entidade:Moat Cailin>Moat Cailin</entidade>. There is only one reason Baelish could be taking her there - he means to return her to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, straight into the arms of the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>. Recalling their earlier discussion of a marriage proposal, Sansa realizes that the proposal is not for him, but for her, and furiously declares that she would rather die than marry Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> corrects her and clarifies that she will be marrying Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, then calms her down by convincing her that nobody will look for her there, and suggesting that this is her best opportunity for revenge. Sansa reluctantly agrees.

    The <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> greet Sansa and Baelish  At <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> itself, the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> and their households greet Sansa and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>. After a tense moment, Sansa graciously accepts Roose's welcome, putting on an air of politeness that protected her in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, while from afar, Ramsay's bedwarmer and secret lover, <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>, observes with jealousy and anger. Sansa is later shown to her old room, seemingly foreign to her after all this time. To her surprise, the servant attending her welcomes her back and quietly assures her that, "the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> remembers." Later, as Sansa explores the castle, <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> hides his face from her, but seems to have difficulty forcing himself not to call out to her.
Elsewhere in the castle, Baelish subtly warns Ramsay against inflicting any harm on Sansa, and discusses the situation with Roose, who is suspicious of <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s motives in betraying the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>. Baelish points out that <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> is dead, Jaime is one-handed and politically useless, and that Cersei is about to be forced into the background by Margaery, who is quite fond of Sansa. <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, nevertheless, demands to read any messages <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> might send off back to the <entidade:Capital>Capital</entidade>.

At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
King <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon tries unsuccessfully to convince the new <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>, to accept his offer of legitimization. Jon declines <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s offer and reiterates that his place is with the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. Jon also reiterates the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>'s neutrality in the affairs of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> and asks <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> when he plans to leave; <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>'s stores are insufficient to feed the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s army, and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> confirms that his army will leave soon enough to confront the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> before the winter snows trap them at the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. He leaves the fate of the wildling prisoners in Jon's hands, allowing Jon to decide whether to execute them or to see if <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> is more willing to negotiate than Mance. When <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> suggests appointing <entidade:<entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> Thorne><entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> Thorne</entidade> as the new commander of <entidade:Eastwatch-by-the-Sea>Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</entidade>, Jon retorts that "it is better to have your enemies close by than far away." As <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> prepares to leave with his liege, he invites Jon to ponder on the second-to-last stanza on the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> oath: "I am the shield that guards the realms of men." He also assures Jon that <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s leadership advice is offered because the king has taken a liking to him.
Later, at the mess hall, <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> asks Sam about <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade> and it is learned his health is waning and entrusts his care in <entidade:Sam's>Sam's</entidade> hands. Jon begins assigning roles to members of the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. He assigns one black brother to oversee the digging of a new latrine pit to accommodate the wildling prisoners. <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade> also shows respect to <entidade:Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade>>Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade></entidade> Thorne by appointing him as the new <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> Ranger, commending his experience. Finally, <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade> assigns <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade> with the task of restoring and manning the abandoned castle <entidade:Greyguard>Greyguard</entidade>. Slynt refuses Jon not once, but three times. Even after being warned that he is disobeying a direct order, he flippantly tells Jon that he can take his order and 'shove it up his bastard arse.' Having publicly disobeyed and insulted Jon, the <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> orders Janos taken outside, and calls for <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> to fetch him his sword. <entidade:Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade>>Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade></entidade> briefly hesitates but then moves out of the way to let <entidade:Dolorous Edd>Dolorous Edd</entidade> and others grab Slynt, who angrily protests that he has important friends at court and dismisses the matter as a scare tactic.

    Small justice for <entidade:<entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade>.  
Jon has Janos dragged out into the courtyard where, obedient to the laws of his father <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard Stark</entidade> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - he prepares to publicly behead him for treason. Slynt's bluster is lost, and the man who once took a baby girl from her mother's arms and killed her starts crying and begging for mercy, saying he will do whatever Jon asks and that he is afraid. Jon hesitates for a moment, but then fixes his nerve and executes the cowardly former Commander of the City <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> with a single swing of his sword - incidentally exacting small justice on one of the men who betrayed his own father to his death and murdered <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade>'s children. From across the courtyard, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon sees Jon behead Janos for refusing his orders, and slightly nods in approval.

In the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade></entidade>
    <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is accosted by The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>  In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> has been put to work cleaning the main sanctuary of the <entidade:House of Black>House of Black</entidade> and <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade>. She watches as <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade> assists a supplicant in drinking from the temple's well. She protests to <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> that she wants to learn, but he brushes off her discontent. Later on, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is accosted in her room by The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>, who repeatedly asks her who she is, hitting her when she gives the expected response of "no one." <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> eventually arrives and demands to know what is going on, as the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> has overstepped her bounds. He does, however, point out that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> cannot be no one, as she is wearing <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade>'s clothes, is in possession of silver stolen by <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade>, and was about to attack the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> using <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade>'s sword. Realizing his point, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> binds her old clothing to a rock and tosses it into the lagoon along with the stolen silver. She cannot bring herself to discard <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade> so easily, and instead hides it within a sea wall nearby. Back at the House, <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> allows <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> to progress to an inner chamber where she is to assist the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> in stripping and washing corpses. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> is silent when <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks what happens to the bodies after they are cleaned.
    The Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>  
Meanwhile, further south in the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> finally arrive at <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>. <entidade:Sick>Sick</entidade> of the carriage they've been riding in, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> again dismisses the dangers and insists they leave to explore. The pair move through the <entidade:Long Bridge>Long Bridge</entidade>'s markets, where <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> explains the meaning of the various tattoos <entidade:Volantene>Volantene</entidade> slaves must sport. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> nearly loses <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, but finds him observing the sermon of a Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> claims curiosity, since <entidade:<entidade:Thoros>Thoros</entidade> of Myr><entidade:Thoros>Thoros</entidade> of Myr</entidade> was the only <entidade:Red Priest>Red Priest</entidade> in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. The Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade> evangelizes in <entidade:High Valyrian>High Valyrian</entidade>, telling the tale of how she was once a slave herself. Like another Red <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade>, she preaches of a prophesied savior, a <entidade:Dragon Queen>Dragon Queen</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s interest in the scene wanes when the <entidade:High Priestess>Priestess</entidade> halts in her sermon and stares directly into his eyes.
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> next leads <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> to a brothel. Catching sight of a prostitute dressed as Daenerys, <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> woos a dark-haired prostitute, but when she finally agrees to service him, he finds that he can't bring himself to patronize her. He then goes to urinate off the side of the bridge, with <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> losing sight of him. As <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> finishes, he is abducted by Jorah <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, who declares that he is taking him to "the queen."
