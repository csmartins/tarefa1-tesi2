Summary
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade>
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> continues her training with the <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Men</entidade>. She cleans a corpse methodically, which is then taken away by two men. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is obviously curious about what is on the other side of the door through which the corpse was taken. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is about to walk through the door when the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> obstructs her path and latches the door. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> wants to know what happens to the bodies she scrubs clean, but the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> tells her that she will know when the time is right. <entidade:Frustrated>Frustrated</entidade> at the lack of answers, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> demands to play the game of faces. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> tells her that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> has already tried playing the game but failed. She again asks <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> who she is, to which <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> replies that she is no one. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> simply tells <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> to get back to work and is about to walk away when <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks her who she is. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> tells <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> a story about how she was the only daughter of a widowed <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade>, who remarried, producing another daughter. Her stepmother, in order to secure her own daughter’s future, tried to poison her. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> found out about this and sought out the help of the <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Men</entidade> to exact her revenge. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> then asks <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> whether she believed the story, surprising <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>. When <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> doesn’t respond, embarrassed that she bought the Waif’s story, the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> tells her to get back to work, hinting to <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> that to pass the game of faces, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> must be able to lie convincingly. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, when <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is asleep, <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar comes to test <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> again. <entidade:This>This</entidade> time, when he asks <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> who she is, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> tells him how she came to join the <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Men</entidade>, trying to slip in a few lies into the story. However, <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> is able to tell when <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is lying and hits her with a switch whenever she does. He strikes her repeatedly when she insists she hated the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade>. Before he leaves, he tells her that she is lying not only to him, but to herself as well.

    <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> in the <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade> of Faces.  
A grieving father brings his sickly daughter to the <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> of Black and <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade>. He explains to <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> that he has been to every healer in <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade> and spent every penny he had. He tells her that his daughter is suffering and needs to find peace. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> sits besides the girl and tells her a short false story, about how she was sick too, but her father brought her here and when she drank from the temple's well, she was healed. <entidade:This>This</entidade> persuades the sickly girl to drink the poisoned water from the well. The water gives the peace of death to the sickly girl, and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, having successfully proven that she can lie, is brought to the <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade> of Faces with <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar, a great underground chamber that houses thousands of faces. All the faces had been taken from the corpses that the acolytes wash in the temple. The <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Man</entidade> then asks <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> if she is ready to give up who she is to become "no one". After a moment of silence, he then states that she is not ready to become "no one" (she is too attached to her past as a Stark), but that she is ready to become "someone else".

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> Slaver's Bay
    <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> in Slaver's Bay  
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> the western side of Slaver's Bay, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> are still making their way to <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> (on the far opposite eastern side of the region) on foot, after losing their boat passing through the <entidade:Smoking Sea>Smoking Sea</entidade> and the ruins of <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyria</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is annoyed that they didn't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> had hoped, so they're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat. The topic of just why <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was even in <entidade:Bridge Volantis>Volantis</entidade> comes up, and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is surprised that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> did not ask earlier: he explains that he actually fled from <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> because he killed his own father <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he didn't commit, and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved - <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> nods, as this seems as likely a motivation for Kinslaying as any. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> then says that despite how miserable <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> is now, at least he can say that he had a good father. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> asks how he could have known his father <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, but <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> explains he visited the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> once and met him: he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men, a rare thing in the world, but now as the eulogy for Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> members goes, "the world will not see his like again." <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> is shocked to realize he means that his father is dead. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> becomes apologetic and says he thought that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> knew already. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> asks how he died: <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> says he only knows the report he heard, which said that his father led an expedition beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, but there was a mutiny, and <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> was murdered by his own men. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> processes this in silent grief, then changes the subject by saying that they have to keep moving.
As they walk, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> asks why <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> would support <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> and how she would be better than any other rulers , or why <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> would even support her, given that her father was the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> explains that he never used to believe in things like destiny and was very cynical, but after seeing <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> emerge from the flames unharmed with baby dragons, he believes in her now, and the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> is hers by right. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> remains skeptical that this doesn't automatically mean she will be a good queen, given that the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> were famous for going insane, just like Daenerys's own father.
Spotting a slaver ship in the distance, <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> pulls <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to the ground. However, the pair has already been spotted before they start hiding, and the slavers emerge from the trees behind them and take them captive. The lead slaver, <entidade:Malko>Malko</entidade>, intends to return them back to their destination in <entidade:Bridge Volantis>Volantis</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, however, manages to successfully persuade him that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> is one of the most skilled knights in <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, and would fetch a better price being sold to the fighting pits in <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, which have just reopened. Though not in the circumstances they hoped, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> are once again quickly heading towards <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> and <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade>.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>
<entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> approach the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade>, wearing <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade> disguises from the soldiers they killed. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> wonders what <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> will do once they get inside and find <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade>, to which <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> replies that he likes to improvise; <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> sarcastically remarks "That explains the golden hand." Meanwhile, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade> and the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> are already inside the <entidade:Water Gardens>Gardens</entidade>. <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> sends them out to abduct <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade>, telling them to do it "for <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>."
<entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> herself is enjoying another stroll with her betrothed, <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade>, Trystane's father <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade> and his bodyguard <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade> watch from above. <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> comments that they look lovely together, but that they don't realize how dangerous their betrothal is, and that he and <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo</entidade> must protect them. <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> asks if <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo</entidade> remembers how to uses his longaxe, and <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo</entidade> assures him that he does.

    <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> and her intended <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade>  <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> infiltrate the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade> and soon come upon <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> kissing <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade>. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> tries to convince <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> to come with him, but <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> interferes, suspicious of the bloodstains on <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> and Jaime's <entidade:Dornish Lords>Dornish</entidade> robes. When <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> tries to draw his sword, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> quickly knocks him down, to Myrcella's horror. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> tries to lead her away, but they are suddenly attacked by the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade>. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> fights against <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> and <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria</entidade>, while <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> attacks <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> with her spear, driving him away from <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade>. <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> orders <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nym</entidade> to break away from <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> and take <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> prisoner, but as <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nym</entidade> tries to pull her away, they are cut off by <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo</entidade> and <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> Doran's guards, who surround them and force them all to drop their weapons. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> and the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> are all taken into custody.
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>
<entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> arrives in King’s <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and is on his way to meet <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> when he is confronted by <entidade:Brother Lancel>Brother Lancel</entidade> and some other <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade>. <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel</entidade> warns <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> that they have purged King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> of its corrupt ways, and the new King’s <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> will not tolerate his prostitution business. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> dismisses these threats.
Cersei, meeting with <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade>, continues to deny her involvement in <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> Tyrell’s arrest by the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade>. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> is not fooled and warns that <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> will not tolerate this insult. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> claims that she is the insulted one since Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>, who was promised to her, prefers the company of men. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> then explains why she summoned Baelish; she is suspicious where his loyalties truly lie and asks him whether she can rely on the the <entidade:Vale Arryn>Vale</entidade> to fight for the <entidade:Iron Throne>Throne</entidade> if the time comes. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> assures her that young <entidade:Robin Arryn>Robin</entidade> heeds his advice and he will always counsel loyalty to the <entidade:Iron Throne>Throne</entidade>. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> then reveals that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is back in <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, where <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> has arranged for her to marry <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade>. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is infuriated by the Boltons’ betrayal. To add fuel to the fire, <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> adds that marrying the last remaining <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> gives the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> a stronger hold over the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> than an alliance with a hated southern house. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> counsels patience and suggests letting the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> and <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> fight each other, and when the victor is still recovering from the battle, step in and defeat him. He suggests that Cersei’s uncle <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan Lannister</entidade> muster a force or have <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> lead an army to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> contemptuously claims that her uncle doesn’t have the courage to lead an army, while <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is away on a “sensitive diplomatic mission.” <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> proposes that the soldiers of the <entidade:Vale Arryn>Vale</entidade> could fight instead but <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is unsure of Baelish’s ability to lead an army. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> convinces her, stating that he "lives to serve". All <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> wants in return is to be named <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> agrees to talk to the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> about this.
<entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> returns to King’s <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> after learning of her grandson’s arrest. <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> tries to talks <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> into releasing <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade>. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> sticks to her claim that it was the <entidade:Faith Militant>Faith Militant</entidade> who arrested <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> and she had nothing to do with it. <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> warns <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> that her actions have endangered the Lannister-Tyrell alliance – the very alliance that is supplying the capital with food. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> informs <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> that the <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> has called for a preliminary hearing to determine whether the charges against <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> have merit and expresses confidence that <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> will be acquitted.

    <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> is arrested.  
The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> interrogates <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> first, who refutes the accusations against him. He then questions <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade>, who also denies any knowledge of it. The <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> then calls in <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade>, in character as Loras’s "squire", who claims that the accusations against <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> are in fact true. <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> also admits that <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> walked in on them once, but didn’t seem surprised. To support his testimony, <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> tells the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> of a birthmark <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> has that is shaped like <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, much to Loras' shock and fury. Deciding that this is more than enough evidence for a trial, the <entidade:High Sparrow>High Sparrow</entidade> has <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> arrested. Since <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> bore false witness before the Gods, she is arrested too. As <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> is forcefully dragged away, she calls out for <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>, paralyzed with indecision, while <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> sadly regards Cersei's barely contained smug expression.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is joined by <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> in her room. She offers to help <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> take a bath, so she is presentable to <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> during the wedding. While she is washing Sansa's back, <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> mentions three other girls whom <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> had been with, and how he ultimately victimized them after a while because they bored him. Knowing that <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> is trying to frighten her, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> startles <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> by revealing that she knows about her relationship with <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade>. She coolly tells <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> that she is a <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> of <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> and will not be intimidated by the likes of her, and dismisses her to finish her bath herself, though she is visibly shaken by Myranda's story.

    <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is wed.  <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, when <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> comes to fetch <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> for the wedding, she refuses to hold Reek’s arm, even after he pleads with her to do so, saying that <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> will punish him if she doesn’t. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> coldly asks if he thinks she cares what <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> does to him, and strides past him. Then, in front of the Godswood, Reek gives <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> away to <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> (who actually allows <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to call himself Theon Greyjoy) during the wedding ceremony, which is officiated by <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> and attended by many <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lords</entidade>. After retreating to the bedroom, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> orders <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> to take her clothes off. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> is about to leave but <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> tells him he must stay. <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> quips to <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, "You grew up with her as a girl, now watch her become a woman." <entidade:Annoyed>Annoyed</entidade> by Sansa's hesitance, he angrily rips open the back of her dress and pushes her face-down over the side of the bed. As he unbuckles his clothes, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> obediently remains still but begins crying softly. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> is visibly distraught and begins silently crying himself, as <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> proceeds to rape her, and forcefully consummate their marriage.
