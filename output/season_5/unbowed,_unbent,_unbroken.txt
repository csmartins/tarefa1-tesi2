Summary
In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> continues her training with the Faceless <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade>. She cleans a corpse methodically, which is then taken away by two men. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is obviously curious about what is on the other side of the door through which the corpse was taken. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is about to walk through the door when the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> obstructs her path and latches the door. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> wants to know what happens to the bodies she scrubs clean, but the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> tells her that she will know when the time is right. Frustrated at the lack of answers, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> demands to play the game of faces. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> tells her that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> has already tried playing the game but failed. She again asks <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> who she is, to which <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> replies that she is no one. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> simply tells <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> to get back to work and is about to walk away when <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks her who she is. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> tells <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> a story about how she was the only daughter of a widowed Lord, who remarried, producing another daughter. Her stepmother, in order to secure her own daughter’s future, tried to poison her. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> found out about this and sought out the help of the Faceless <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade> to exact her revenge. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> then asks <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> whether she believed the story, surprising <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>. When <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> doesn’t respond, embarrassed that she bought the <entidade:<entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>’s><entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>’s</entidade> story, the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> tells her to get back to work, hinting to <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> that to pass the game of faces, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> must be able to lie convincingly. Later, when <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is asleep, <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade> comes to test <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> again. This time, when he asks <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> who she is, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> tells him how she came to join the Faceless <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade>, trying to slip in a few lies into the story. However, <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> is able to tell when <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is lying and hits her with a switch whenever she does. He strikes her repeatedly when she insists she hated the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>. Before he leaves, he tells her that she is lying not only to him, but to herself as well.

    <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> in the <entidade:Hall of Faces>Hall of Faces</entidade>.  
A grieving father brings his sickly daughter to the <entidade:House of Black>House of Black</entidade> and <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade>. He explains to <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> that he has been to every healer in <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> and spent every penny he had. He tells her that his daughter is suffering and needs to find peace. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> sits besides the girl and tells her a short false story, about how she was sick too, but her father brought her here and when she drank from the temple's well, she was healed. This persuades the sickly girl to drink the poisoned water from the well. The water gives the peace of death to the sickly girl, and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, having successfully proven that she can lie, is brought to the <entidade:Hall of Faces>Hall of Faces</entidade> with <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade>, a great underground chamber that houses thousands of faces. All the faces had been taken from the corpses that the acolytes wash in the temple. The <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Man</entidade> then asks <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> if she is ready to give up who she is to become "no one". After a moment of silence, he then states that she is not ready to become "no one" (she is too attached to her past as a Stark), but that she is ready to become "someone else".

In <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay
    Jorah and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> in <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay  
On the western side of <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay, <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and Jorah <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> are still making their way to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> (on the far opposite eastern side of the region) on foot, after losing their boat passing through the <entidade:Smoking Sea>Smoking Sea</entidade> and the ruins of <entidade:Old Valyria>Old Valyria</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is annoyed that they didn't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as Jorah had hoped, so they're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat. The topic of just why <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was even in <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade> comes up, and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is surprised that Jorah did not ask earlier: he explains that he actually fled from <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> because he killed his own father <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>. He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he didn't commit, and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved - Jorah nods, as this seems as likely a motivation for <entidade:Kinslaying>Kinslaying</entidade> as any. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> then says that despite how miserable Jorah is now, at least he can say that he had a good father. Jorah asks how he could have known his father Jeor <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, but <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> explains he visited the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> once and met him: he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men, a rare thing in the world, but now as the eulogy for <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> members goes, "the world will not see his like again." Jorah is shocked to realize he means that his father is dead. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> becomes apologetic and says he thought that Jorah knew already. Jorah asks how he died: <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> says he only knows the report he heard, which said that his father led an expedition beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, but there was a mutiny, and Jeor was murdered by his own men. Jorah processes this in silent grief, then changes the subject by saying that they have to keep moving.
As they walk, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> asks why Jorah would support <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> and how she would be better than any other rulers , or why <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> would even support her, given that her father was the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade>. Jorah explains that he never used to believe in things like destiny and was very cynical, but after seeing Daenerys emerge from the flames unharmed with baby dragons, he believes in her now, and the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> is hers by right. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> remains skeptical that this doesn't automatically mean she will be a good queen, given that the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> were famous for going insane, just like Daenerys's own father.
Spotting a slaver ship in the distance, Jorah pulls <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to the ground. However, the pair has already been spotted before they start hiding, and the slavers emerge from the trees behind them and take them captive. The lead slaver, <entidade:Malko>Malko</entidade>, intends to return them back to their destination in <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, however, manages to successfully persuade him that Jorah is one of the most skilled knights in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, and would fetch a better price being sold to the fighting pits in <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, which have just reopened. Though not in the circumstances they hoped, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Jorah are once again quickly heading towards <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> and <entidade:Queen Daenerys>Queen Daenerys</entidade>.

In <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>
<entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> and Jaime approach the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade>, wearing Martell disguises from the soldiers they killed. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> wonders what Jaime will do once they get inside and find Myrcella, to which Jaime replies that he likes to improvise; <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> sarcastically remarks "That explains the golden hand." Meanwhile, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade> and the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> are already inside the Gardens. Ellaria sends them out to abduct Myrcella, telling them to do it "for Oberyn."
Myrcella herself is enjoying another stroll with her betrothed, <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane Martell</entidade>, Trystane's father <entidade:Prince Doran>Prince Doran</entidade> Martell and his bodyguard <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade> watch from above. Doran comments that they look lovely together, but that they don't realize how dangerous their betrothal is, and that he and Areo must protect them. Doran asks if Areo remembers how to uses his longaxe, and Areo assures him that he does.

    Myrcella and her intended <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane Martell</entidade>  Jaime and <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> infiltrate the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade> and soon come upon Myrcella kissing Trystane. Jaime tries to convince Myrcella to come with him, but Trystane interferes, suspicious of the bloodstains on <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> and Jaime's <entidade:Dornish>Dornish</entidade> robes. When Trystane tries to draw his sword, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> quickly knocks him down, to Myrcella's horror. Jaime tries to lead her away, but they are suddenly attacked by the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade>. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> fights against <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> and Nymeria, while <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> attacks Jaime with her spear, driving him away from Myrcella. <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> orders Nym to break away from <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> and take Myrcella prisoner, but as Nym tries to pull her away, they are cut off by Areo and <entidade:Prince Doran>Prince Doran</entidade>'s guards, who surround them and force them all to drop their weapons. Jaime, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, Ellaria and the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> are all taken into custody.
In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>
<entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> Baelish arrives in <entidade:King’s Landing>King’s Landing</entidade> and is on his way to meet Cersei when he is confronted by <entidade:Brother Lancel>Brother Lancel</entidade> and some other <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade>. Lancel warns Baelish that they have purged <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> of its corrupt ways, and the new <entidade:King’s Landing>King’s Landing</entidade> will not tolerate his prostitution business. Baelish dismisses these threats.
Cersei, meeting with Baelish, continues to deny her involvement in <entidade:<entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras Tyrell</entidade>’s><entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras Tyrell</entidade>’s</entidade> arrest by the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade>. Baelish is not fooled and warns that <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> will not tolerate this insult. Cersei claims that she is the insulted one since <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade>, who was promised to her, prefers the company of men. Cersei then explains why she summoned Baelish; she is suspicious where his loyalties truly lie and asks him whether she can rely on the the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> to fight for the <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> if the time comes. Baelish assures her that young Robin heeds his advice and he will always counsel loyalty to the <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. Baelish then reveals that Sansa is back in <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, where Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> has arranged for her to marry Ramsay. Cersei is infuriated by the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>’ betrayal. To add fuel to the fire, Baelish adds that marrying the last remaining Stark gives the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> a stronger hold over the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> than an alliance with a hated southern house. Baelish counsels patience and suggests letting the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> fight each other, and when the victor is still recovering from the battle, step in and defeat him. He suggests that <entidade:Cersei’s>Cersei’s</entidade> uncle <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan Lannister</entidade> muster a force or have <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> lead an army to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. Cersei contemptuously claims that her uncle doesn’t have the courage to lead an army, while Jaime is away on a “sensitive diplomatic mission.” Baelish proposes that the soldiers of the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> could fight instead but Cersei is unsure of <entidade:Baelish’s>Baelish’s</entidade> ability to lead an army. Baelish convinces her, stating that he "lives to serve". All Baelish wants in return is to be named <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. Cersei agrees to talk to the King about this.
<entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna Tyrell</entidade> returns to <entidade:King’s Landing>King’s Landing</entidade> after learning of her grandson’s arrest. Olenna tries to talks Cersei into releasing Loras. Cersei sticks to her claim that it was the <entidade:<entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant><entidade:Faith Militant>Faith</entidade> Militant</entidade> who arrested Loras and she had nothing to do with it. Olenna warns Cersei that her actions have endangered the <entidade:Lannister-Tyrell>Lannister-Tyrell</entidade> alliance – the very alliance that is supplying the capital with food. Cersei informs Olenna that the <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> has called for a preliminary hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit and expresses confidence that Loras will be acquitted.

    Margaery is arrested.  
The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> interrogates Loras first, who refutes the accusations against him. He then questions Margaery, who also denies any knowledge of it. The <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> then calls in <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade>, in character as <entidade:Loras’s>Loras’s</entidade> "squire", who claims that the accusations against Loras are in fact true. <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> also admits that Margaery walked in on them once, but didn’t seem surprised. To support his testimony, <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> tells the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> of a birthmark Loras has that is shaped like <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, much to Loras' shock and fury. Deciding that this is more than enough evidence for a trial, the <entidade:High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade>>High <entidade:High Sparrow>Sparrow</entidade></entidade> has Loras arrested. Since Margaery bore false witness before the <entidade:Old Gods>Gods</entidade>, she is arrested too. As Margaery is forcefully dragged away, she calls out for Tommen, paralyzed with indecision, while Olenna sadly regards Cersei's barely contained smug expression.

In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
At <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, Sansa is joined by <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> in her room. She offers to help Sansa take a bath, so she is presentable to Ramsay during the wedding. While she is washing Sansa's back, <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> mentions three other girls whom Ramsay had been with, and how he ultimately victimized them after a while because they bored him. Knowing that <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> is trying to frighten her, Sansa startles <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> by revealing that she knows about her relationship with Ramsay. She coolly tells <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> that she is a Stark of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> and will not be intimidated by the likes of her, and dismisses her to finish her bath herself, though she is visibly shaken by <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>'s story.

    Sansa is wed.  Later, when <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> comes to fetch Sansa for the wedding, she refuses to hold <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>’s arm, even after he pleads with her to do so, saying that Ramsay will punish him if she doesn’t. Sansa coldly asks if he thinks she cares what Ramsay does to him, and strides past him. Then, in front of the <entidade:Godswood>Godswood</entidade>, <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> gives Sansa away to Ramsay (who actually allows <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to call himself <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>) during the wedding ceremony, which is officiated by Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> and attended by many <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern Lords</entidade>. After retreating to the bedroom, Ramsay orders Sansa to take her clothes off. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> is about to leave but Ramsay tells him he must stay. Ramsay quips to <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, "You grew up with her as a girl, now watch her become a woman." <entidade:Annoyed>Annoyed</entidade> by Sansa's hesitance, he angrily rips open the back of her dress and pushes her face-down over the side of the bed. As he unbuckles his clothes, Sansa obediently remains still but begins crying softly. <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> is visibly distraught and begins silently crying himself, as Ramsay proceeds to rape her, and forcefully consummate their marriage.
