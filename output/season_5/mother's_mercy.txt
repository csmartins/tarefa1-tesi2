 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
As the snow begins to melt, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is elated. Still grieving, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> prepares to march on <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>. However, one of his generals informs him that nearly half of his men have deserted - mainly the sellswords, who have also run away with all their horses. Another soldier comes with more bad news: <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> has hanged herself out of grief for her daughter. As he views her body, his general reports that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> has fled.

    <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>.  
Marching across the fields with less than half the men he once had, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> has his men start preparing for the siege, but is instead met in combat early by the <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> army. The mounted <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> army easily defeats Stannis' tired and mountless army. Wounded and exhausted, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> fights off two remaining soldiers in the aftermath of the carnage and collapses against a tree.
<entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:Selwyn Tarth>Tarth</entidade> was warned by <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> of Stannis's arrival and leaves her watch for Sansa's signal. After the battle she waits and finds a wounded <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>. She declares who she is and that her king was killed by his brother's shadow that bore his face, before drawing her sword to slay him. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, having lost everything, simply accepts his fate to die: he tells <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> to do her "duty". After a moment's hesitation, <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> swings her sword at him. Elsewhere, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> finishes off the few remaining <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> soldiers and heads back to <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>.

    Theon and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> prepare to jump.  
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> itself, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> uses a corkscrew she pocketed earlier to escape her room, and seeks out the tower to light her signal. After the candle is lit, she sees the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> clash with Stannis's army and sees this as a time to slip out of <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>. Desperately running across the ramparts, she is caught by <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> and <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> threatens <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> with a bow, however <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, weary and realizing she can't escape a shot from a bow, tells her to kill her while there is still a part of the real her left. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> tells <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> that <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> needs her to have an heir and nothing more afterwards, but he does not need all of her in one piece to accomplish that. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> braces herself for the worst as Myrnada tenses her bow, but the worst does not come... for her anyway. Theon finally breaks the Bolton's hold on him and causes <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> to misfire, then grabs and hurls the screaming sadist over the ramparts, where she is killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and Theon run, but with <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> just returning from the battle, they find themselves with nowhere to go. Hoping to land in deep snow and survive the long fall, the two of them grasp their hands together and jump off the rampart.

 <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade> 
    <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> kills <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade>  Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> is looking upon three young girls in the <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> brothel. Of the three girls, two begin to cry and scream when they are whipped by <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade>, however the last girl has no reaction when whipped. <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> sends the two weak girls away, and punches the last in the stomach. However, the last girl is revealed to be <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, after removing her fake face. She pulls out a knife and stabs <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> in both eyes and chest repeatedly, and puts a gag in his mouth to silence his cries. She then reveals her identity and reminds <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> of how he killed her dance master, <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio Forel</entidade>, before calling him 'no one' and slitting his throat.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> then returns to the <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> of Black and <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> and returns the face that she used to hide her identity. However, <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar and the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> appear and say that Meryn's life was not hers to take, and that a debt must be paid. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> grabs <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> as <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> pulls out a vial, presumably containing some kind of poison. However, he drinks the poison himself and collapses, with <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> screaming for him to stay alive. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> states that he was her friend, and hears Jaqen's voice behind her say 'he was no one'. She turns around to see that the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> now has Jaqen's face. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks who the person on the floor with Jaqen's face is. <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade>, in the Waif's body, says that he is no one. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> begins to remove multiple faces from the person on the floor, until she sees her own face. She then begins to lose her sight as her eyes turn white and screams for help.

With <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> gone, her council is unsure on how they should continue. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> addresses both <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and Daario's feelings for her, understanding all too well how one could love the wrong woman. The three argue about Jorah's betrayal, but they will not make any judgments without <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade> first. The dragon was seen taking her north and that is where they need to search for their queen. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>, still recovering from his injuries, offers to go with <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade>, as does <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> firmly nixes both ideas: <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> is needed to command the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> in keeping the city under control, while <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is the only one of them to have any actual political experience. He expresses confidence that with Missandei's help, the pair of them should be able to keep <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade> under control until they return with <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys</entidade>.
As <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> watches <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> and <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> depart the city, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> calmly walks up to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. Teasing <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> about abandoning him in <entidade:Bridge Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, he is pleased to see <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> already settling into a role that suits him. He reminds <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that he has experience running a city full of people trying to kill each other, and implies that he – and his little birds – are there to help.

However, Myrcella's expression changes, the smile fades on her face and her nose starts to bleed. She collapses in Jaime's arms. <entidade:Sack>Back</entidade> in <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> wipes the blood from her nose and takes the antidote for the poison coated on her lips.

<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> tells <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> what he witnessed at <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. He hopes the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> can't climb the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> as there is not enough <entidade:Dragonglass>Dragonglass</entidade> or <entidade:Low Valyrian>Valyrian</entidade> steel in <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> to combat them. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> asks <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> if he can travel to <entidade:Oldtown>Oldtown</entidade> to study and replace <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> as the new <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> of the <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>. He feels there is no other way he can help them as he cannot fight, he is also afraid for <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and her child's safety, and wishes to take them along. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> reminds him that the The Citadel will also not allow <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> to be with women, but is humored to hear that it is already too late for that. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> promises he will return, they toast to that and <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> sees his only friend off.
Davos, having returned to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> at Stannis' orders, urges <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> to convince the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> for aid. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> refuses him, saying that they wouldn't side with <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and this is not their fight. Both of them are shocked to see a speechless and despondent <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> return to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> pressures <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> for news, specifically asking after <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>, but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> remains silent. After seeing the empty look in her eyes, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> lets her leave.

    <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> deals the final blow to the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade>.  
That night, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is reading messages when his steward <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> tells him that a wildling knows of the whereabouts of his long missing uncle. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> quickly rushes with <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> to a gathered group of <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> men, only to see a placard with the word "traitor" written on it. He turns around to find his <entidade:Sworn Brothers>Brothers</entidade> staring him down. <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> makes the first move and stabs the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade>. "For the Watch" <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Thorne</entidade> says, as well as the others as they close in and continue stabbing him. One after another, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> is betrayed, "For the <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>." Finally a tearful-eyed <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> approaches last. After a moment of pause <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> gasps "Olly" before Olly delivers the final blow, repeating the pledge. The brothers leave <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> to die alone in the snow.
