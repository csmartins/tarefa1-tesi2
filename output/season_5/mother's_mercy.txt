 Summary 
 In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> 
As the snow begins to melt, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is elated. Still grieving, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> prepares to march on <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. However, one of his generals informs him that nearly half of his men have deserted - mainly the sellswords, who have also run away with all their horses. Another soldier comes with more bad news: <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> has hanged herself out of grief for her daughter. As he views her body, his general reports that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> has fled.

    <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.  
Marching across the fields with less than half the men he once had, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> has his men start preparing for the siege, but is instead met in combat early by the <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> army. The mounted <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> army easily defeats <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' tired and mountless army. Wounded and exhausted, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> fights off two remaining soldiers in the aftermath of the carnage and collapses against a tree.
<entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade> was warned by <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> of <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s arrival and leaves her watch for Sansa's signal. After the battle she waits and finds a wounded <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>. She declares who she is and that her king was killed by his brother's shadow that bore his face, before drawing her sword to slay him. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, having lost everything, simply accepts his fate to die: he tells <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> to do her "duty". After a moment's hesitation, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> swings her sword at him. Elsewhere, Ramsay finishes off the few remaining Baratheon soldiers and heads back to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.

    Theon and Sansa prepare to jump.  
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> itself, Sansa uses a corkscrew she pocketed earlier to escape her room, and seeks out the tower to light her signal. After the candle is lit, she sees the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> clash with <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s army and sees this as a time to slip out of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Desperately running across the ramparts, she is caught by <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> and <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> threatens Sansa with a bow, however Sansa, weary and realizing she can't escape a shot from a bow, tells her to kill her while there is still a part of the real her left. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> tells <entidade:Sansa that Ramsay>Sansa that Ramsay</entidade> needs her to have an heir and nothing more afterwards, but he does not need all of her in one piece to accomplish that. Sansa braces herself for the worst as <entidade:Myrnada>Myrnada</entidade> tenses her bow, but the worst does not come... for her anyway. Theon finally breaks the <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>'s hold on him and causes <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> to misfire, then grabs and hurls the screaming sadist over the ramparts, where she is killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below. Sansa and Theon run, but with Ramsay just returning from the battle, they find themselves with nowhere to go. Hoping to land in deep snow and survive the long fall, the two of them grasp their hands together and jump off the rampart.

 In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> 
    <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> kills <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade>  <entidade:Ser Meryn>Ser Meryn</entidade> Trant is looking upon three young girls in the <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> brothel. Of the three girls, two begin to cry and scream when they are whipped by Meryn, however the last girl has no reaction when whipped. Meryn sends the two weak girls away, and punches the last in the stomach. However, the last girl is revealed to be <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade>, after removing her fake face. She pulls out a knife and stabs Meryn in both eyes and chest repeatedly, and puts a gag in his mouth to silence his cries. She then reveals her identity and reminds Meryn of how he killed her dance master, <entidade:<entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade>, before calling him 'no one' and slitting his throat.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> then returns to the <entidade:House of Black>House of Black</entidade> and <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> and returns the face that she used to hide her identity. However, <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade> and the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> appear and say that Meryn's life was not hers to take, and that a debt must be paid. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> grabs <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> as <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade>><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> as <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade></entidade> pulls out a vial, presumably containing some kind of poison. However, he drinks the poison himself and collapses, with <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> screaming for him to stay alive. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> states that he was her friend, and hears <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade>'s voice behind her say 'he was no one'. She turns around to see that the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> now has <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade>'s face. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks who the person on the floor with <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade>'s face is. <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade>, in the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>'s body, says that he is no one. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> begins to remove multiple faces from the person on the floor, until she sees her own face. She then begins to lose her sight as her eyes turn white and screams for help.

 In <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> 
With Daenerys gone, her council is unsure on how they should continue. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> addresses both Jorah and Daario's feelings for her, understanding all too well how one could love the wrong woman. The three argue about Jorah's betrayal, but they will not make any judgments without Daenerys first. The dragon was seen taking her north and that is where they need to search for their queen. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>, still recovering from his injuries, offers to go with Jorah and Daario, as does <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>. Daario firmly nixes both ideas: <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> is needed to command the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> in keeping the city under control, while <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is the only one of them to have any actual political experience. He expresses confidence that with Missandei's help, the pair of them should be able to keep <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> under control until they return with Daenerys.
As <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> watches Daario and Jorah depart the city, <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> calmly walks up to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>. Teasing <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> about abandoning him in <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, he is pleased to see <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> already settling into a role that suits him. He reminds <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he has experience running a city full of people trying to kill each other, and implies that he – and his little birds – are there to help.

Unfortunately, he's also not interested in finding them any food. Daenerys wanders away to find something for them, but is thrown to see a trio of <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> bloodriders emerge. Within minutes, an entire khalasar has her surrounded. Understanding what might happen to her, she quickly removes a ring and drops it in the grass, determined to leave a trail.

Aboard the ship, Myrcella and Jaime talk about Cersei. <entidade:Jamie>Jamie</entidade> begins to come clean to Myrcella, awkwardly telling her that we cannot choose who we love. Myrcella then reveals that she knows that <entidade:Jamie>Jamie</entidade> is her real father, and that she is glad that he is, and the two embrace. However, Myrcella's expression changes, the smile fades on her face and her nose starts to bleed. She collapses in Jaime's arms. Back in <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, Ellaria wipes the blood from her nose and takes the antidote for the poison coated on her lips.

With bloody feet, Cersei eventually makes it to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> and bursts into tears. Upon entering the gates, Cersei finds her uncle <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan Lannister</entidade>, Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> and <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> waiting for her. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> attempts to comfort her by covering her body with a cloak.

<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> tells Sam what he witnessed at <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. He hopes the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers can't climb the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> as there is not enough <entidade:Dragonglass>Dragonglass</entidade> or Valyrian steel in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> to combat them. Sam asks Jon if he can travel to <entidade:Oldtown>Oldtown</entidade> to study and replace Aemon as the new Maester of the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. He feels there is no other way he can help them as he cannot fight, he is also afraid for <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and her child's safety, and wishes to take them along. Jon reminds him that the The <entidade:Citadel>Citadel</entidade> will also not allow Sam to be with women, but is humored to hear that it is already too late for that. Sam promises he will return, they toast to that and Jon sees his only friend off.
Davos, having returned to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> at <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' orders, urges Jon to convince the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> for aid. Jon refuses him, saying that they wouldn't side with <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> and this is not their fight. Both of them are shocked to see a speechless and despondent <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> return to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> pressures <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> for news, specifically asking after Shireen, but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> remains silent.

He turns around to find his <entidade:Sworn Brothers>Brothers</entidade> staring him down. Thorne makes the first move and stabs the <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade>. "For the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>" Thorne says, as well as the others as they close in and continue stabbing him. <entidade:One>One</entidade> after another, <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> is betrayed, "For the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>." Finally a tearful-eyed <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> approaches last. After a moment of pause Jon gasps "<entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade>" before <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> delivers the final blow, repeating the pledge. The brothers leave Jon to die alone in the snow.
