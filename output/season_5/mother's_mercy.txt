 <entidade:Summary>Summary</entidade> 
 In the North 
As the snow begins to melt, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is elated. Still grieving, Stannis prepares to march on <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. However, one of his generals informs him that nearly half of his men have deserted - mainly the sellswords, who have also run away with all their horses. Another soldier comes with more bad news: <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> has hanged herself out of grief for her daughter. As he views her body, his general reports that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> has fled.

    <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.  
Marching across the fields with less than half the men he once had, Stannis has his men start preparing for the siege, but is instead met in combat early by the Bolton army. The mounted Bolton army easily defeats Stannis' tired and mountless army. Wounded and exhausted, Stannis fights off two remaining soldiers in the aftermath of the carnage and collapses against a tree.
<entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of Tarth was warned by <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> of Stannis's arrival and leaves her watch for Sansa's signal. After the battle she waits and finds a wounded Stannis. She declares who she is and that her king was killed by his brother's shadow that bore his face, before drawing her sword to slay him. Stannis, having lost everything, simply accepts his fate to die: he tells <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> to do her "duty". After a moment's hesitation, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> swings her sword at him. Elsewhere, Ramsay finishes off the few remaining Baratheon soldiers and heads back to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.

    Theon and Sansa prepare to jump.  
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> itself, Sansa uses a corkscrew she pocketed earlier to escape her room, and seeks out the tower to light her signal. After the candle is lit, she sees the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> clash with Stannis's army and sees this as a time to slip out of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Desperately running across the ramparts, she is caught by <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> and <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> threatens Sansa with a bow, however Sansa, weary and realizing she can't escape a shot from a bow, tells her to kill her while there is still a part of the real her left. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> tells Sansa that Ramsay needs her to have an heir and nothing more afterwards, but he does not need all of her in one piece to accomplish that. Sansa braces herself for the worst as Myrnada tenses her bow, but the worst does not come... for her anyway. Theon finally breaks the Bolton's hold on him and causes <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> to misfire, then grabs and hurls the screaming sadist over the ramparts, where she is killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below. Sansa and Theon run, but with Ramsay just returning from the battle, they find themselves with nowhere to go. Hoping to land in deep snow and survive the long fall, the two of them grasp their hands together and jump off the rampart.

 In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> 
    Arya kills <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade>  Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> is looking upon three young girls in the <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> brothel. Of the three girls, two begin to cry and scream when they are whipped by Meryn, however the last girl has no reaction when whipped. Meryn sends the two weak girls away, and punches the last in the stomach. However, the last girl is revealed to be <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade>, after removing her fake face. She pulls out a knife and stabs Meryn in both eyes and chest repeatedly, and puts a gag in his mouth to silence his cries. She then reveals her identity and reminds Meryn of how he killed her dance master, <entidade:<entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade>, before calling him 'no one' and slitting his throat.
Arya then returns to the House of Black and White and returns the face that she used to hide her identity. However, <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>'ghar and the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> appear and say that Meryn's life was not hers to take, and that a debt must be paid. The <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> grabs Arya as <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> pulls out a vial, presumably containing some kind of poison. However, he drinks the poison himself and collapses, with Arya screaming for him to stay alive. Arya states that he was her friend, and hears <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade>'s voice behind her say 'he was no one'. She turns around to see that the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade> now has <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade>'s face. Arya asks who the person on the floor with <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade>'s face is. <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade>, in the <entidade:Waif>Waif</entidade>'s body, says that he is no one. Arya begins to remove multiple faces from the person on the floor, until she sees her own face. She then begins to lose her sight as her eyes turn white and screams for help.

 In Meereen 
With Daenerys gone, her council is unsure on how they should continue. Tyrion addresses both Jorah and Daario's feelings for her, understanding all too well how one could love the wrong woman. The three argue about Jorah's betrayal, but they will not make any judgments without Daenerys first. The dragon was seen taking her north and that is where they need to search for their queen. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>, still recovering from his injuries, offers to go with Jorah and Daario, as does Tyrion. Daario firmly nixes both ideas: <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> is needed to command the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> in keeping the city under control, while Tyrion is the only one of them to have any actual political experience. He expresses confidence that with <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade>'s help, the pair of them should be able to keep Meereen under control until they return with Daenerys.
As Tyrion watches Daario and Jorah depart the city, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> calmly walks up to Tyrion. Teasing Tyrion about abandoning him in <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, he is pleased to see Tyrion already settling into a role that suits him. He reminds Tyrion that he has experience running a city full of people trying to kill each other, and implies that he – and his little birds – are there to help.

In the <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> Sea

Meanwhile, Daenerys finds herself far away from Meereen, atop an impressive hill in a sea of green grass. <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> is still recovering from the wounds he received from the arena in Meereen and is uninterested in flying back. Unfortunately, he's also not interested in finding them any food. Daenerys wanders away to find something for them, but is thrown to see a trio of <entidade:Dothraki>Dothraki</entidade> bloodriders emerge. <entidade:Within>Within</entidade> minutes, an entire khalasar has her surrounded. Understanding what might happen to her, she quickly removes a ring and drops it in the grass, determined to leave a trail.

However, Myrcella's expression changes, the smile fades on her face and her nose starts to bleed. She collapses in Jaime's arms. <entidade:Back>Back</entidade> in <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, Ellaria wipes the blood from her nose and takes the antidote for the poison coated on her lips.

He hopes the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> can't climb the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> as there is not enough <entidade:Dragonglass>Dragonglass</entidade> or Valyrian steel in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> to combat them. Sam asks Jon if he can travel to <entidade:Oldtown>Oldtown</entidade> to study and replace <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> as the new <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> of the Watch.

Jon reminds him that the <entidade:The <entidade:The Citadel>Citadel</entidade>>The <entidade:The Citadel>Citadel</entidade></entidade> will also not allow Sam to be with women, but is humored to hear that it is already too late for that.

Davos, having returned to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> at Stannis' orders, urges Jon to convince the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade> for aid. Jon refuses him, saying that they wouldn't side with Stannis and this is not their fight.
