<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> confronts a troubling decision. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> returns to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> visits the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Iron Bank>Bank</entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> encounters someone from her past. <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> reluctantly oversees a traditional celebration of athleticism.

    <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> watches wildlings enter inside <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>.  
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>, and the surviving few thousand wildlings from <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> arrive at the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, before the gates of <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. For a tense moment Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade> hesitates to let all of their old enemies through, but finally he gives the order to open the gate. Thousands of wildlings come through the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> itself, including many women and children, and even the giant <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>. Many men of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> glare at them. <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> coolly says to <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that he has a good heart (to save so many people), but that it may end up getting them all killed .
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> reunites with <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade>, but is despondent, saying that the mission was a disaster and they only managed to save a small fraction of the wildlings at <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> points to different wildlings passing by and notes that each of them would have died if he had done nothing at all, so it wasn't a complete failure.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
During the night at <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon's army camp, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> gazes intently into the flames of her tent's brazier hoping to receive visions from the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the distance, several tents burst into flames, sending confused men shouting, and one horse screams as he runs away on fire. During the night, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> and twenty men raided the camp, burning much of their food supplies and heavy siege weapons. Hundreds of horses also died in the fire. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> notes that their situation is now dire: they don't have enough food to make the march back to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> or to advance to <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, and without their siege weapons they have little chance of storming the castle to take its food supplies anyway. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> asks how this could happen and <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> insists that the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> know the North's terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> suggests that the watchmen were either collaborating with the enemy or simply not attentive enough at their posts to allow such a disaster - either way he orders them to be executed. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> says to slaughter the dead horses for their meat, which should at least buy them a little time.
Stannis's demeanor becomes grave and half-stunned, as he believes there is only one course of action to take. He starts by ordering <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> to return to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> to ask for more supplies from <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> is confused given that even if <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> did decide to resupply them the provisions probably wouldn't reach them in time, and wonders why <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> would send him instead of just a messenger. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> insists that it is because he needs his <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> to engage in diplomacy to win <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> over - but in reality, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> sends <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> away so he wouldn't be around to stop what <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> was planning on doing next.
<entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> visits the tent of Stannis's daughter <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> to say goodbye. She is enjoying reading a book by Grand <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> Munkun about the <entidade:Water Dancer>Dance</entidade> of the Dragons, a major civil war in the history of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>. They share a laugh about how a knight tried to kill the dragon <entidade:Vhagar>Vhagar</entidade> by sneaking up on it with a mirrored shield, but it didn't fool the dragon, who promptly roasted the knight. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> gives her a wooden stag figurine he has been carving as a present. She asks why he has been so nice to her, and he explains that he felt bad that his son <entidade:Matthos Seaworth>Matthos</entidade> always insisted that his father learn to read and he never did. <entidade:Matthos Seaworth>Matthos</entidade> died in the war, and by teaching <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> to read <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> helped him fulfill his son's wish.
Some time after <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> leaves, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> himself visits <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade>, visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly. He asks about her reading, and she explains that "The <entidade:Water Dancer>Dance</entidade> of the Dragons" was a great civil war between <entidade:Rhaenyra>Rhaenyra</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> and her half-brother <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade>, each of whom thought they deserved to sit on the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. The great lords of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> each declared for one or the other, dividing the realm in half, and tearing <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> apart. <entidade:Brother Lancel>Brother</entidade> fought brother and dragon fought dragon in the devastating war. It was a disaster for <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> as well, who never truly recovered. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> asks who she would have chosen, <entidade:Rhaenyra>Rhaenyra</entidade> or <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade>, and she says she wouldn't have chosen either - it was all of the choosing sides that plunged <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> into civil war. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> gravely responds that sometimes the world forces a man to choose even if he doesn't want to, but if he stays true to himself he knows what he must do, and then it isn't really a choice at all - even if he hates doing it. <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> says it's all right and she wants to help him, though he responds that she doesn't even know what he wants. She doesn't care and asks if there is any way she can help, and he says that there is. <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> insists that she wants to, because she is Princess <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> of <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>, his daughter. They hug and he embraces her tightly and <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> whispers "forgive me".
Later, <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> exits her tent as well and sees all of the soldiers gathered around, and asks where her father is. <entidade:Coming>Coming</entidade> to the front of the assembly, she sees <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> in front of a wooden pyre with a large stake in the middle. She starts shouting to see her father, but is grabbed by soldiers who drag her to the pyre and tie her to the stake. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> soothingly tries to calm her by saying that it will all be over soon. Shireen's cries ring out through the camp, but no one intervenes. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and Shireen's mother <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> then appear in the crowd. <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> sees them and begs her mother and father to help, but they do nothing. <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> insists aloud to herself that the sacrifice is what the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> wants.

    <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> watches as <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> is sacrificed.  
<entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> begins praying and announces that they offer up the life of this girl to the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>, and sets the pyre on fire. As she explained to <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> before, she believes that sacrificing Shireen's life - which contains the power of a king's blood - will gain the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of Light's favor, who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> believes that if they do nothing, they will remain snowbound and all starve to death here. <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> continues to repeatedly cry "Mother, please!" and "Father, please!" - eventually even <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade>, who only had a cold and non-existent relationship with her daughter, suddenly breaks and rushes forward, begging that they can't go through with it. Soldiers restrain her, however, and she sinks to the ground crying in despair. Shireen's cries become even more frightened, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> continues to watch even as <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> sobs on the ground. As the flames begin to consume <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> she wordlessly screams in pain and fear, and eventually even <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> cannot bear to look anymore as she burns to death.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>
    <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> sits and speaks with <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade>.  
<entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> is escorted into the main apartments of the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade> by <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade>, to be received by <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade> in a luxurious solar, along with <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade>, Doran's son <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> <entidade:Elia Martell>Martell</entidade>, and Jaime's "niece" <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>. They lounge on a circle of couches, <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> cuddling with <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade>. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> notes that <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> is wearing a revealing Dornish-style dress now, and she says that the warm climate of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> agrees with her.
<entidade:Coming>Coming</entidade> to the point, <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> asks <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> why he has snuck in to <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> to abduct <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> back to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. He says he feared for her safety, but when <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> insists why he didn't just send a letter by messenger-raven, he explains that they received a threatening message: Myrcella's <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> lion pendant jammed in the mouth of dead viper. <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> glares at <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade>, while a confused <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> explains that her pendant was simply stolen from her room.
<entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> asks if <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> intends to behead him, but (acting more sympathetic now that <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> revealed he was threatened first) he says that he will not, because he wishes to avoid war. He has seen what war can do, bodies piled on the battlefield and orphans left starving in cities at home, and he will not lead his people into that. <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> bluntly asks what he will do, break bread with the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>? However he says that is precisely what he will do, as wine is poured for <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, and he raises his own goblet and offers a toast to <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade>, <entidade:First Builder>First</entidade> of His Name, long may he reign. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> returns the toast but <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> deliberately pours out her wine onto the floor in disgust.
<entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> asks if <entidade:After Tommen>Tommen</entidade> indeed commands that his sister be returned to the capital, and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> politely says he does, to which <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> says he cannot disobey his king - <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> will return to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. She is upset for a moment, but then <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> explains his solution: his son <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> will go along with them, to take over the seat on the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> which <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> granted to <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>, but which was vacated by his death. <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> insists that for the alliance between the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> and <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> to continue, the engagement of <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> and <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> must stand, and <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> will simply take his uncle Oberyn's place on the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade>. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> finds Doran's request entirely reasonable, and <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> is ecstatic that she will not be separated from <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade>, so <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> agrees. <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> gets up to leave and snaps that it is no wonder that <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> cannot stand, because he has no spine. As she walks out he grabs her by the arm and lowers his voice, saying that she is the mother of four of his nieces and for their sake he hopes she has a long and happy life but if she talks to him that way again, she will not.
<entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then asks what fate will befall <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, who is still imprisoned. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> punched out <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> when they tried to take <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade>, and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is asked what the normal punishment is for striking a prince where he is from. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> politely insists that <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> was only following orders and they can't punish him for simply following Jaime's commands. <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> agrees, saying he has learned the value of mercy from his father, but that he has one "condition".
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the prison cells, <entidade:Nymeria Sand>Nymeria</entidade> and <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene Sand</entidade> spar out of boredom, as <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> tries to ignore them and get some sleep. The guards arrive and release <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, and <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> mocks him as he leaves. <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo</entidade> leads <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> back to the solar where <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade>, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, and the rest remain. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> apologizes to <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> when he sees him and says he didn't mean anything by hitting him before. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then gladly informs <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> that the <entidade:Martells>Martells</entidade> agreed to let <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> go with <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, but on one condition: wordlessly, <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo</entidade> then delivers it by striking <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> in the face with his elbow, the large guard captain hitting him so hard that he is knocked to the floor. Thus his debt to <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane</entidade> is settled.
Later, in the courtyard, <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo</entidade> brings <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> and the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> before <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> in his wheelchair. <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> gives <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> an ultimatum: she can either choose to swear allegiance to him (and that she will not try something like this again), or she can choose death. Restraining tears, she kneels and kisses his hand. <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran</entidade> says that he believes in second chances and she is forgiven - but sternly warns her that he does not believe in third chances.
<entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> then finds <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> in a study writing a letter back to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> informing of his return. He writes very poorly, given that he is using his non-dominant left hand, and <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> remarks that he writes like a seven year old. <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> notes how odd it is that she and <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> were looked down on for their sexuality in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is scorned for his incestuous love for <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> - to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement - though a hundred years ago, if his name were <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>, no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship. Cryptically (perhaps spurred by Doran), she then says that she knows "your daughter" <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella</entidade> had no part in what befell <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>, and maybe even <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is innocent of that (and indeed he is, as <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> volunteered for the trial by combat). She exits, and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is left to ponder what seems to be her apology.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade>
    <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, or "Lanna", sells oysters, clams, and cockles on the canal streets.  
Arya, in her "Lanna" persona, is once again pushing her cart through the canal streets of <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade> selling oysters, clams, and cockles. She passes the "Thin man" who sells insurance to sailors, having been given a mission by the <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Men</entidade> to assassinate him with poisoned oysters. Just as she reaches him, however, she stops in her tracks and stares fixedly on a boat at the dock which has caught her full attention. Stepping out of the boat is Master of Coin <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace Tyrell</entidade> - and the commander of his guards is none other than Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn Trant</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, one of the names on Arya's kill list which she recites as a daily prayer. <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> helped betray her father and killed her <entidade:Water Dancing>Water Dancing</entidade> trainer <entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio Forel</entidade>. <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> was sent by <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> to treat with the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Iron Bank>Bank</entidade> of <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade>, which has started calling in the crown's massive debts, and at least try to gain a little more time to deal with the problem from the bankers. <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> is greeted at the dock by the bank's representative, <entidade:Tycho Nestoris>Tycho Nestoris</entidade>. <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> addresses <entidade:Tycho Nestoris>Tycho</entidade> politely and amiably, though he doesn't realize that his jokes aren't really funny. All the while <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> remains frozen and staring at Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade>, ignoring the thin man's requests for some of her oysters.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> abandons her mission to assassinate the <entidade:Thin Man>Thin Man</entidade>, and instead follows Ser <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> as he accompanies <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade>. After visiting the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Iron Bank>Bank</entidade> building, <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> and a few other <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> guards depart from <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> at night and go to visit a local brothel. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> sneaks into the brothel under the guise of simply selling her oysters and clams from a hand basket. The bouncer <entidade:Brusco>Brusco</entidade> doesn't want her in at first but the prostitute <entidade:Lhara>Lhara</entidade>, who is one of Arya's regular customers, tells him to let her stay, as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> sells a few and then makes her way to the back chambers where she spies on <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> from behind some shutters. <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> catches a brief look at her at one point, and she seems vaguely familiar, but he just shrugs it off (it has been years since he last saw her, she is older and thus looks different, she has different Braavosi-style hair and clothes, and he doesn't think that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> would logically be in Braavos).
The brothel's madam presents several girls in succession to <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade>, but he passes on each as too old. She brings out her best and most expensive prostitute, a beautiful young woman named <entidade:Anara>Anara</entidade>, but <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> again dismisses her as too old. The madam slowly realizes that <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> is perversely interested in young girls who are barely teenagers - around Arya's age - so she brings out a very young girl who <entidade:Meryn Trant>Meryn</entidade> accepts gruffly, bluntly saying he expects another "fresh" one tomorrow. After he leaves the madam runs into <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and shoos her out.
Later, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> returns to the <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> of Black and <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> empty-handed, having abandoned her first mission for the <entidade:Faceless Man>Faceless Men</entidade>. When <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar asks what happened, she lies to him and says that the <entidade:Thin Man>Thin Man</entidade> simply wasn't hungry today and didn't order any of her oysters. <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> quips that perhaps this is why he is a "thin man", and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> promises that she will follow through on the assassination tomorrow. She departs, and while <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> seems to suspect that she was lying, he makes no outward reaction to it.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>
    <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> claps to start the fights.  
Attended by <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade>, and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> sits in the royal box at the Daznak's <entidade:Great Pit>Pit</entidade>. <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade> arrives late, claiming to have been putting the final touches on the arrangements for the event. When the first two combatants take the field, <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> indicates that <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is to start the fight with a clap of her hands. <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> verbally spars with <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> for much of the first match, drawing Daenerys's attention from the spectacle in front of her. Her attention returns to the arena when <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> gives the traditional dedication to her. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> spite of Jorah's previous successes, he has decidedly mixed results in the grand melee he finds himself in. The grand melee begins with six fighters, with <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> pairing up against a <entidade:Norvosi>Norvosi</entidade> long-axe fighter. The <entidade:Norvosi>Norvosi</entidade> is able to land several blows against <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>, eventually knocking him to the ground, however <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> is able to bring out his dagger and eventually bury it into the Norvosi's chest after a brief melee. 

    <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> and <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> during the riots.  
Meanwhile, a <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> <entidade:Water Dancer>Water Dancer</entidade> easily dispatches his <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> opponent, and then focuses his attention on <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> finds himself hopelessly outmatched by the <entidade:Water Dancer>Water Dancer</entidade> and suffers many cuts from his opponent's rapier. During the fight, a <entidade:Meerenese <entidade:Great Pit>Pit</entidade> Fighter>Meerenese <entidade:Great Pit>Pit</entidade> Fighter</entidade> is able to lance his opponent in the chest. The <entidade:Water Dancer>Water Dancer</entidade> eventually knocks <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> to the ground, and is about to deliver a killing blow, but fails to notice the pit fighter who kills him from behind. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> then battles the pit fighter and kills him and is the last fighter standing.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> this moment <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> suddenly grabs and hurls a spear at the royal box – embedding itself in a <entidade:Second Sons>Son</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade> sneaking up behind <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade>. The <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade> reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering collaborating <entidade:Great Masters>Masters</entidade> and freedmen alike – <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> included. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> evacuate <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> from the royal box, while <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> rescues <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade>. Finding the exits blocked, the group makes a stand in the center of the <entidade:Great Pit>Pit</entidade> with remainder of the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> defenders. Seeing they are hopelessly outnumbered, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> takes Missandei's hand and closes her eyes, ready to face her death.

    <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> climbs on, and rides <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade>.  
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> that moment, a draconic screech pierces the air, and <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> descends upon the arena, flying out of a giant flame burst.
Many of the <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> scatter in terror as <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> bites, crushes and mercilessly burns the nearest ones to death. The <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> rally enough to attack <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> with spears, which <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> hastily makes an effort to remove. Trying to get <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> out of the Sons' range, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> climbs atop his back and bids him to fly ("Valahd"), becoming the first <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> dragonrider in over a century. The <entidade:Second Sons>Sons</entidade> of the <entidade:Harpy Son>Harpy</entidade> routed for now, <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade>, <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> look on in astonishment as <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> soars away.
