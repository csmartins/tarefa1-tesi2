<entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> confronts a troubling decision. Jon returns to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. Mace visits the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Bank. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> encounters someone from her past. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> reluctantly oversees a traditional celebration of athleticism.


At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    Jon watches wildlings enter inside <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>.  
<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>, and the surviving few thousand wildlings from <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade> arrive at the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, before the gates of <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>.Â For a tense moment <entidade:Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade>>Ser <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade></entidade> Thorne hesitates to let all of their old enemies through, but finally he gives the order to open the gate. Thousands of wildlings come through the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> itself, including many women and children, and even the giant <entidade:Wun Wun>Wun Wun</entidade>. Many men of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> glare at them. <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> coolly says to Jon that he has a good heart (to save so many people), but that it may end up getting them all killed .
Jon reunites with <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade>, but is despondent, saying that the mission was a disaster and they only managed to save a small fraction of the wildlings at <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. Sam points to different wildlings passing by and notes that each of them would have died if he had done nothing at all, so it wasn't a complete failure.

In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
During the night at <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon's army camp, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> gazes intently into the flames of her tent's brazier hoping to receive visions from the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade>. In the distance, several tents burst into flames, sending confused men shouting, and one horse screams as he runs away on fire. During the night, Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> and twenty men raided the camp, burning much of their food supplies and heavy siege weapons. Hundreds of horses also died in the fire. Davos notes that their situation is now dire: they don't have enough food to make the march back to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> or to advance to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, and without their siege weapons they have little chance of storming the castle to take its food supplies anyway. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> asks how this could happen and Davos insists that the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> know the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>'s terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> suggests that the watchmen were either collaborating with the enemy or simply not attentive enough at their posts to allow such a disaster - either way he orders them to be executed. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> says to slaughter the dead horses for their meat, which should at least buy them a little time.
<entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s demeanor becomes grave and half-stunned, as he believes there is only one course of action to take. He starts by ordering Davos to return to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> to ask for more supplies from <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>. Davos is confused given that even if Jon did decide to resupply them the provisions probably wouldn't reach them in time, and wonders why <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> would send him instead of just a messenger. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> insists that it is because he needs his <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King to engage in diplomacy to win Jon over - but in reality, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> sends Davos away so he wouldn't be around to stop what <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> was planning on doing next.
Davos visits the tent of <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s daughter <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen Baratheon</entidade> to say goodbye. She is enjoying reading a book by <entidade:Grand Maester Munkun>Grand Maester Munkun</entidade> about the Dance of the <entidade:Gold Dragons>Dragons</entidade>, a major civil war in the history of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>. They share a laugh about how a knight tried to kill the dragon <entidade:Vhagar>Vhagar</entidade> by sneaking up on it with a mirrored shield, but it didn't fool the dragon, who promptly roasted the knight. Davos gives her a wooden stag figurine he has been carving as a present. She asks why he has been so nice to her, and he explains that he felt bad that his son <entidade:Matthos Seaworth>Matthos</entidade> always insisted that his father learn to read and he never did. <entidade:Matthos Seaworth>Matthos</entidade> died in the war, and by teaching Davos to read Shireen helped him fulfill his son's wish.
Some time after Davos leaves, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> himself visits Shireen, visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly. He asks about her reading, and she explains that "The Dance of the <entidade:Gold Dragons>Dragons</entidade>" was a great civil war between <entidade:<entidade:Rhaenyra Targaryen>Rhaenyra</entidade> Targaryen><entidade:Rhaenyra Targaryen>Rhaenyra</entidade> Targaryen</entidade> and her half-brother <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade>, each of whom thought they deserved to sit on the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. The great lords of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> each declared for one or the other, dividing the realm in half, and tearing <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> apart. Brother fought brother and dragon fought dragon in the devastating war. It was a disaster for <entidade:House Targaryen>House Targaryen</entidade> as well, who never truly recovered. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> asks who she would have chosen, <entidade:Rhaenyra Targaryen>Rhaenyra</entidade> or <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade>, and she says she wouldn't have chosen either - it was all of the choosing sides that plunged <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> into civil war. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> gravely responds that sometimes the world forces a man to choose even if he doesn't want to, but if he stays true to himself he knows what he must do, and then it isn't really a choice at all - even if he hates doing it. Shireen says it's all right and she wants to help him, though he responds that she doesn't even know what he wants. She doesn't care and asks if there is any way she can help, and he says that there is. Shireen insists that she wants to, because she is <entidade:Princess Shireen>Princess Shireen</entidade> of <entidade:House Baratheon>House Baratheon</entidade>, his daughter. They hug and he embraces her tightly and <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> whispers "forgive me".
Later, Shireen exits her tent as well and sees all of the soldiers gathered around, and asks where her father is. Coming to the front of the assembly, she sees <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> in front of a wooden pyre with a large stake in the middle. She starts shouting to see her father, but is grabbed by soldiers who drag her to the pyre and tie her to the stake. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> soothingly tries to calm her by saying that it will all be over soon. <entidade:Shireen's>Shireen's</entidade> cries ring out through the camp, but no one intervenes. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Shireen's>Shireen's</entidade> mother <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> then appear in the crowd. Shireen sees them and begs her mother and father to help, but they do nothing. <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> insists aloud to herself that the sacrifice is what the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> wants.

    <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> watches as Shireen is sacrificed.  
<entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> begins praying and announces that they offer up the life of this girl to the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade>, and sets the pyre on fire. As she explained to <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> before, she believes that sacrificing <entidade:Shireen's>Shireen's</entidade> life - which contains the power of a king's blood - will gain the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade>'s favor, who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> believes that if they do nothing, they will remain snowbound and all starve to death here. Shireen continues to repeatedly cry "<entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade>, please!" and "<entidade:Father>Father</entidade>, please!" - eventually even <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade>, who only had a cold and non-existent relationship with her daughter, suddenly breaks and rushes forward, begging that they can't go through with it. Soldiers restrain her, however, and she sinks to the ground crying in despair. <entidade:Shireen's>Shireen's</entidade> cries become even more frightened, but <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> continues to watch even as <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> sobs on the ground. As the flames begin to consume Shireen she wordlessly screams in pain and fear, and eventually even <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> cannot bear to look anymore as she burns to death.

In <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>
    Jaime sits and speaks with Doran.  
<entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> is escorted into the main apartments of the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade> by <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade>, to be received by <entidade:Prince Doran>Prince Doran</entidade> Martell in a luxurious solar, along with <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade>, Doran's son <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane Martell</entidade>, and Jaime's "niece" <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myrcella Baratheon</entidade>. They lounge on a circle of couches, Myrcella cuddling with Trystane. Jaime notes that Myrcella is wearing a revealing <entidade:Dornish>Dornish</entidade>-style dress now, and she says that the warm climate of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> agrees with her.
Coming to the point, Doran asks Jaime why he has snuck in to <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> to abduct Myrcella back to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. He says he feared for her safety, but when Doran insists why he didn't just send a letter by messenger-raven, he explains that they received a threatening message: Myrcella's Lannister lion pendant jammed in the mouth of dead viper. Doran glares at Ellaria, while a confused Myrcella explains that her pendant was simply stolen from her room.
Jaime asks if Doran intends to behead him, but (acting more sympathetic now that Jaime revealed he was threatened first) he says that he will not, because he wishes to avoid war. He has seen what war can do, bodies piled on the battlefield and orphans left starving in cities at home, and he will not lead his people into that. Ellaria bluntly asks what he will do, break bread with the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>? However he says that is precisely what he will do, as wine is poured for Jaime, and he raises his own goblet and offers a toast to <entidade:King Tommen>King Tommen</entidade>, <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> of His Name, long may he reign. Jaime returns the toast but Ellaria deliberately pours out her wine onto the floor in disgust.
Doran asks if Tommen indeed commands that his sister be returned to the capital, and Jaime politely says he does, to which Doran says he cannot disobey his king - Myrcella will return to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. She is upset for a moment, but then Doran explains his solution: his son Trystane will go along with them, to take over the seat on the Small <entidade:Council â>Council</entidade> which <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> granted to Oberyn, but which was vacated by his death. Doran insists that for the alliance between the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> and <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> to continue, the engagement of Trystane and Myrcella must stand, and Trystane will simply take his uncle Oberyn's place on the Small <entidade:Council â>Council</entidade>. Jaime finds Doran's request entirely reasonable, and Myrcella is ecstatic that she will not be separated from Trystane, so Jaime agrees. Ellaria gets up to leave and snaps that it is no wonder that Doran cannot stand, because he has no spine. As she walks out he grabs her by the arm and lowers his voice, saying that she is the mother of four of his nieces and for their sake he hopes she has a long and happy life but if she talks to him that way again, she will not.
Jaime then asks what fate will befall <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, who is still imprisoned. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> punched out Trystane when they tried to take Myrcella, and Jaime is asked what the normal punishment is for striking a prince where he is from. Jaime politely insists that <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> was only following orders and they can't punish him for simply following Jaime's commands. Trystane agrees, saying he has learned the value of mercy from his father, but that he has one "condition".
In the prison cells, Nymeria and <entidade:<entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> Sand><entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> Sand</entidade> spar out of boredom, as <entidade:Obara Sand>Obara</entidade> tries to ignore them and get some sleep. The guards arrive and release <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, and <entidade:Tyene Sand>Tyene</entidade> mocks him as he leaves. Areo leads <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> back to the solar where Doran, Jaime, and the rest remain. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> apologizes to Trystane when he sees him and says he didn't mean anything by hitting him before. Jaime then gladly informs <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> that the <entidade:Martells>Martells</entidade> agreed to let <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> go with Jaime, but on one condition: wordlessly, Areo then delivers it by striking <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> in the face with his elbow, the large guard captain hitting him so hard that he is knocked to the floor. Thus his debt to Trystane is settled.
Later, in the courtyard, Areo brings Ellaria and the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> before <entidade:Prince Doran>Prince Doran</entidade> in his wheelchair. Doran gives Ellaria an ultimatum: she can either choose to swear allegiance to him (and that she will not try something like this again), or she can choose death. Restraining tears, she kneels and kisses his hand. Doran says that he believes in second chances and she is forgiven - but sternly warns her that he does not believe in third chances.
Ellaria then finds Jaime in a study writing a letter back to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> informing of his return. He writes very poorly, given that he is using his non-dominant left hand, and Ellaria remarks that he writes like a seven year old. Ellaria notes how odd it is that she and Oberyn were looked down on for their sexuality in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, and Jaime is scorned for his incestuous love for Cersei - to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement - though a hundred years ago, if his name were Targaryen, no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship. <entidade:Cryptically>Cryptically</entidade> (perhaps spurred by Doran), she then says that she knows "your daughter" Myrcella had no part in what befell Oberyn, and maybe even Jaime is innocent of that (and indeed he is, as Oberyn volunteered for the trial by combat). She exits, and Jaime is left to ponder what seems to be her apology.

In <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>
    <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, or "<entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>", sells oysters, clams, and cockles on the canal streets.  
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, in her "<entidade:Lanna>Lanna</entidade>" persona, is once again pushing her cart through the canal streets of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade> selling oysters, clams, and cockles. She passes the "<entidade:Thin Man>Thin</entidade> man" who sells insurance to sailors, having been given a mission by the Faceless <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade> to assassinate him with poisoned oysters. Just as she reaches him, however, she stops in her tracks and stares fixedly on a boat at the dock which has caught her full attention. Stepping out of the boat is <entidade:Master of Coin>Master of Coin</entidade> <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace Tyrell</entidade> - and the commander of his guards is none other than <entidade:Ser Meryn>Ser Meryn</entidade> Trant of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, one of the names on <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s kill list which she recites as a daily prayer. Meryn helped betray her father and killed her <entidade:Water Dancing>Water Dancing</entidade> trainer <entidade:<entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel><entidade:Syrio Forel>Syrio</entidade> Forel</entidade>. Mace was sent by <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> to treat with the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Bank of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, which has started calling in the crown's massive debts, and at least try to gain a little more time to deal with the problem from the bankers. Mace is greeted at the dock by the bank's representative, <entidade:<entidade:Tycho Nestoris>Tycho</entidade> Nestoris><entidade:Tycho Nestoris>Tycho</entidade> Nestoris</entidade>. Mace addresses <entidade:Tycho Nestoris>Tycho</entidade> politely and amiably, though he doesn't realize that his jokes aren't really funny. All the while <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> remains frozen and staring at <entidade:Ser Meryn>Ser Meryn</entidade>, ignoring the thin man's requests for some of her oysters.
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> abandons her mission to assassinate the <entidade:<entidade:Thin Man>Thin</entidade> Man><entidade:Thin Man>Thin</entidade> Man</entidade>, and instead follows <entidade:Ser Meryn>Ser Meryn</entidade> as he accompanies Mace. After visiting the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> Bank building, Meryn and a few other Lannister guards depart from Mace at night and go to visit a local brothel. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> sneaks into the brothel under the guise of simply selling her oysters and clams from a hand basket. The bouncer <entidade:Brusco>Brusco</entidade> doesn't want her in at first but the prostitute <entidade:Lhara>Lhara</entidade>, who is one of <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s regular customers, tells him to let her stay, as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> sells a few and then makes her way to the back chambers where she spies on Meryn from behind some shutters. Meryn catches a brief look at her at one point, and she seems vaguely familiar, but he just shrugs it off (it has been years since he last saw her, she is older and thus looks different, she has different <entidade:<entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade>-style><entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade>-style</entidade> hair and clothes, and he doesn't think that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> would logically be in <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>).
The brothel's madam presents several girls in succession to Meryn, but he passes on each as too old. She brings out her best and most expensive prostitute, a beautiful young woman named <entidade:Anara>Anara</entidade>, but Meryn again dismisses her as too old. The madam slowly realizes that Meryn is perversely interested in young girls who are barely teenagers - around <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s age - so she brings out a very young girl who Meryn accepts gruffly, bluntly saying he expects another "fresh" one tomorrow. After he leaves the madam runs into <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> and shoos her out.
Later, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> returns to the <entidade:House of Black>House of Black</entidade> and <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> empty-handed, having abandoned her first mission for the Faceless <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade>. When <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade> asks what happened, she lies to him and says that the <entidade:<entidade:Thin Man>Thin</entidade> Man><entidade:Thin Man>Thin</entidade> Man</entidade> simply wasn't hungry today and didn't order any of her oysters. <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> quips that perhaps this is why he is a "thin man", and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> promises that she will follow through on the assassination tomorrow. She departs, and while <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> seems to suspect that she was lying, he makes no outward reaction to it.

In <entidade:Meereen â>Meereen</entidade>
    <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> claps to start the fights.  
Attended by <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade>, Missandei, and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade>, Daenerys sits in the royal box at the Daznak's <entidade:Pit Fighter>Pit</entidade>. <entidade:<entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade>><entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade></entidade> arrives late, claiming to have been putting the final touches on the arrangements for the event. When the first two combatants take the field, <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> indicates that Daenerys is to start the fight with a clap of her hands. Daario verbally spars with <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> for much of the first match, drawing Daenerys's attention from the spectacle in front of her. Her attention returns to the arena when Jorah <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> gives the traditional dedication to her. In spite of Jorah's previous successes, he has decidedly mixed results in the grand melee he finds himself in. The grand melee begins with six fighters, with Jorah pairing up against a <entidade:Norvosi>Norvosi</entidade> long-axe fighter. The <entidade:Norvosi>Norvosi</entidade> is able to land several blows against Jorah, eventually knocking him to the ground, however Jorah is able to bring out his dagger and eventually bury it into the <entidade:Norvosi>Norvosi</entidade>'s chest after a brief melee. 

    <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> and Missandei during the riots.  
Meanwhile, a <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> <entidade:Water Dancer>Water Dancer</entidade> easily dispatches his <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> opponent, and then focuses his attention on Jorah. Jorah finds himself hopelessly outmatched by the <entidade:Water Dancer>Water Dancer</entidade> and suffers many cuts from his opponent's rapier. During the fight, a Meerenese <entidade:<entidade:Pit Fighter>Pit</entidade> Fighter><entidade:Pit Fighter>Pit</entidade> Fighter</entidade> is able to lance his opponent in the chest. The <entidade:Water Dancer>Water Dancer</entidade> eventually knocks Jorah to the ground, and is about to deliver a killing blow, but fails to notice the pit fighter who kills him from behind. Jorah then battles the pit fighter and kills him and is the last fighter standing.
At this moment Jorah suddenly grabs and hurls a spear at the royal box âÂ embedding itself in a Son of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> sneaking up behind Daario. The Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering collaborating Masters and freedmen alike â <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> included. Jorah and Daario evacuate Daenerys from the royal box, while <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> rescues Missandei. Finding the exits blocked, the group makes a stand in the center of the <entidade:Pit Fighter>Pit</entidade> with remainder of the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> defenders. Seeing they are hopelessly outnumbered, Daenerys takes Missandei's hand and closes her eyes, ready to face her death.

    <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> climbs on, and rides <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade>.  
At that moment, a draconic screech pierces the air, and <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> descends upon the arena, flying out of a giant flame burst.
Many of the Sons scatter in terror as <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> bites, crushes and mercilessly burns the nearest ones to death. The Sons rally enough to attack <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> with spears, which Daenerys hastily makes an effort to remove. Trying to get <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> out of the Sons' range, Daenerys climbs atop his back and bids him to fly ("<entidade:Valahd>Valahd</entidade>"), becoming the first Targaryen dragonrider in over a century. The Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> routed for now, Daario, Jorah, Missandei and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> look on in astonishment as <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> soars away.
