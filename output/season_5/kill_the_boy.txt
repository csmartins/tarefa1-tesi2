<entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> makes a difficult decision in <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>. Jon recruits the help of an unexpected ally. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> searches for Sansa. Theon remains under Ramsay's control.


In <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>
Missandei     Daenerys watches on as her dragons set a head of great family on fire and proceed to eat him.   watches over the wounded <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>, who is still unconscious from his wounds sustained by the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>. Daenerys and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade> wake over the deceased <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> Selmy. <entidade:<entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade>><entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade></entidade> enters to extend his condolences. Daario suggests pulling back around the pyramid to use it as a base from which to eradicate the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>. Daenerys instead opts for rounding up the leaders of each great family in <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, including <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade>. The leaders are brought to the catacombs where <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade> and <entidade:Viserion>Viserion</entidade> are chained up. Daenerys's <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> push the leaders slowly towards the two dragons, who can be heard growling from the darkness. Daenerys states that good mothers do not give up on their children, they discipline them if needed, but never give up on them. She nods to Daario to push one of the leaders further forward. A stream of fire coming from <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade> sets the man aflame before he is torn apart and eaten by both dragons. Daenerys suggests that the dragons may determine the innocence of the captives and touches <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade>'s back as if she wanted to push him but then she pretends she wants not to overfeed the dragons and lets the rest of the men be led away.
<entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> wakes up later with Missandei sitting beside him. He asks if <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> survived the attack by the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> but Missandei shakes her head. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> thinks he has failed <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade>, his men and Daenerys -- a claim Missandei denies. Missandei tells him he shouldn't be ashamed for being wounded given that he was ambushed and outnumbered, but <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> says he is ashamed that he was afraid when he was stabbed. Missandei says that everyone fears death. However, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> says it isn't death he fears, it is the thought of never getting to see Missandei again that terrified him. Missandei is noticeably touched and kisses <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>.
Daenerys asks Missandei whether she should reopen the fighting pits. Missandei only says that she has seen Daenerys listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong. Daenerys visits the imprisoned <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade>, who begs for his life. Daenerys tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits, but only for free men. She also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> to forge a bond with the people of the city, and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already. She leaves a very confused <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> to ponder that he will live, and that he will soon be <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>'s prince consort.

At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade>  Sam reads a note from <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay to <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade> updating him on Daenerys's situation. Sam praises Daenerys's courage but <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade> worries about his great-niece's safety because she is all alone, under siege, and with hardly anyone to guide her, while her "last relation" is useless and dying thousands of miles away. <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> enters to speak with Aemon in private. He needs the maester's advice on a controversial order that many of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> will hate him for. Aemon tells Jon that half the men at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> already hate him, but that he should trust in his command. He says that Jon will not enjoy being <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade>, but with luck, he may find the strength to do what needs to be done. Jon is told to "kill the boy, and let the man be born."
Jon then meets with <entidade:<entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane><entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane</entidade> and offers to forge an alliance with the wildlings, bidding <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> to go north of the wall and rally them all. He will open the gates for them and give them land south of the wall in which to settle. In return, the wildlings will fight alongside the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>’s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> when <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers arrive. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> is initially reluctant and to convince him, Jon unlocks his chains, freeing him. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> relents, and reveals that most of the wildlings are up at <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. Jon offers him horses and men to bring the wildlings back. <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> tells him that they’ll need ships to bring his people back, which Jon says he’ll borrow from <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>. <entidade:<entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>'s><entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>'s</entidade> final condition is that Jon accompany him as a guarantee that the wildlings will not fall prey to any traps set by the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>.
The men of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>’s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> do not take news of the alliance well, citing the countless innocent lives lost due to the wildlings. Even <entidade:Jon’s>Jon’s</entidade> friend Edd rejects this decision, stating that the wildlings killed their friends <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> and <entidade:Pyp>Pyp</entidade>. Nevertheless, Jon decides to go ahead with his plan. In the library, Sam tells <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> about his wish to go to <entidade:Citadel>Citadel</entidade> and become a maester before he was sent to the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>’s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, when <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon walks in. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> reminisces about how <entidade:Sam’s>Sam’s</entidade> father, <entidade:Randyll Tarly>Randyll Tarly</entidade>, defeated <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of Ashford. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> wants to know how Sam killed the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker and Sam tells him how he did it with a dagger made of dragonglass. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> muses that it is abundantly available in <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>. Sam has been researching dragonglass and how it can kill <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers, but has yet to come up with anything. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> tells him to continue his research and leaves.
Later, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> tells <entidade:Ser Davos>Ser Davos</entidade> that they will march toward <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> the next morning. Davos suggests waiting until Jon returns with the wildlings, but <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> decides against it, as any delay improves the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>' chances. He also wants to take <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade> and Shireen with them, as he does not think they will be safe at the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, surrounded by criminals. The next morning, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>’s army, with <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> at its head, starts its journey to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>.

In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>
<entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade> and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade>, still pursuing <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, arrive at an inn near <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Podrick thinks that Sansa may be better off at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> now that she is far away from the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, but <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> believes that Sansa will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother - the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>. Their conversation is interrupted by a servant. Correctly suspecting that he is still loyal to the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> tells of her allegiance to <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> and convinces the servant to get a message through to Sansa – her presence still being something of a secret, the old servant seems to gain strength from the idea of a surviving Stark.
In <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, Ramsay <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> and his bedwarmer <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> discuss <entidade:Ramsay’s>Ramsay’s</entidade> upcoming marriage to Sansa. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> admits her jealousy of Sansa, especially since he had promised to marry <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> back when he was a bastard. Ramsay disregards <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>’s insecurities, causing <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> to proclaim that perhaps she will marry too. Ramsay is angered and violently tells her that she is his and she is not going anywhere unless she continues to bore him with her jealousy. He threateningly reminds her what he does to people who bore him, and hearing this <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> swears never to bore him again.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Sansa’s>Sansa’s</entidade> maid carries a message to her. Consoling Sansa that she still has allies in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, she tells Sansa to light a candle in the highest window of the <entidade:Broken Tower>Broken Tower</entidade> if she ever needs help. As Sansa wanders around the castle, coming to the tower where <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> pushed her brother <entidade:Brandon>Brandon</entidade> out of the window, she runs into <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> puts on a friendly façade, talking to Sansa about her mother’s demise. To help Sansa “remember” how things used to be, <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> leads Sansa down to the kennels, where she finds <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, formerly <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>, asleep in one of the cages. Awoken by <entidade:Sansa’s>Sansa’s</entidade> arrival, he just shakes his head, when Sansa calls him "Theon." He warns her that she shouldn't be down there. Seeing <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> in such a pitiful condition, Sansa angrily storms away.

    Sansa at the "family" dinner.  As <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> helps Ramsay get ready for dinner, he confesses to Ramsay that earlier that day, Sansa saw him in his cage. Ramsay, for his own amusement, makes it seem as though he’s going to punish <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> severely, before simply forgiving him. At dinner, Ramsay is initially well-behaved, toasting his wedding to Sansa, but is soon back to his old ways as he forces <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to apologize to Sansa for murdering <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>. With much difficulty, <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> finally mutters an apology. Ramsay then suggests that <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> be the one to give Sansa away at the wedding, since he is the closest thing Sansa has to <entidade:Robert jokingly>kin</entidade> and Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> accepts the suggestion. Seeing that Ramsay is getting complacent, however, Roose has <entidade:Walda Bolton>Walda</entidade> announce that she is pregnant with a boy. Ramsay is clearly distressed by the news, which in turn delights Sansa.
    Roose tells Ramsay about his conception.  
After dinner, Ramsay expresses his distress at the possibility of the unborn child jeopardizing his claim on the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. Roose reprimands his son for disgracing himself at dinner but seemingly dismisses his concern. He then shares the story of <entidade:Ramsay’s>Ramsay’s</entidade> birth; Roose raped a miller’s wife, who had married without his consent, after hanging her husband. A year later, she showed up with Ramsay, claiming that the baby was his. Roose nearly had her whipped and the baby drowned, but when Roose laid eyes upon Ramsay, he was convinced that he was his son and decided to keep him. He then reveals to Ramsay that <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> has an army at <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> plans to take the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> and the road to <entidade:King’s Landing>King’s Landing</entidade> passes through <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, which means that <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> also intends to take the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. He wants <entidade:Ramsay’s>Ramsay’s</entidade> help in defeating <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, and Ramsay agrees.

<entidade:Old Valyria>Old Valyria</entidade>
    <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and Jorah are attacked by the Stonemen  
As Jorah and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> continue their journey to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, and following Jorah's violent reaction to a previous conversation, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are. As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of <entidade:Old Valyria>Old Valyria</entidade>, a shorter route to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria's reputation. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is apprehensive, but still excited to see the ruins of what was once the greatest civilization in the world.
As they catch glimpses of domes, towers and aqueducts, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> recites a poem about the <entidade:Doom of Valyria>Doom of Valyria</entidade>, with Jorah joining in at the end. Suddenly, through the fog, they see <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> fly into view. Although he had been hearing about the dragons for some time, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is still utterly gobsmacked to see one in person. Jorah is struck silent too, as <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> is even bigger and more majestic than when he left. So distracted are they that they don't notice when the statues on a nearby aqueduct stand up and leap at the boat: they are <entidade:Stone <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade>>Stone <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade></entidade> - victims of greyscale so far gone that they have been sent to live out the rest of their lives in quarantine in the ruins. Jorah tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> not to let them touch him and fights them off.  However, as <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is tied up, he is cornered at one end of the boat with a stone man advancing on him while Jorah battles more at the other end.  Just before the stone man is able to grab him, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> rolls off of the boat and into the water to escape, where he is then pulled down by more stone men under the water.
An undetermined amount of time later, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> wakes up and finds himself on a shore, dragged out of the water by Jorah. After confirming to each other that they had not been touched by the stone men, Jorah tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he hopes to find a fishing village and get a boat soon, otherwise they'll have to walk all the way around <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay to eventually reach <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> seems up for it and Jorah goes to look for firewood so they can make camp. However, once out of <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s view, he pulls back his sleeve to inspect the cracked skin on his wrist, confirming that he had been infected with greyscale during the fight with the stone men. He looks at <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and then glances in the direction of <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, knowing that even if he dies, he needs to get <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> to Daenerys.
