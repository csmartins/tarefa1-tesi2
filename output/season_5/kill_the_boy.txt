<entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> makes a difficult decision in Meereen. Jon recruits the help of an unexpected ally. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> searches for Sansa. Theon remains under Ramsay's control.


In Meereen
<entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade>     Daenerys watches on as her dragons set a head of great family on fire and proceed to eat him.   watches over the wounded <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>, who is still unconscious from his wounds sustained by the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>. Daenerys and <entidade:<entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> Naharis><entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> Naharis</entidade> wake over the deceased Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade>. <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade> enters to extend his condolences. <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> suggests pulling back around the pyramid to use it as a base from which to eradicate the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>. Daenerys instead opts for rounding up the leaders of each great family in Meereen, including <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade>. The leaders are brought to the catacombs where <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade> and <entidade:Viserion>Viserion</entidade> are chained up. Daenerys's Unsullied push the leaders slowly towards the two dragons, who can be heard growling from the darkness. Daenerys states that good mothers do not give up on their children, they discipline them if needed, but never give up on them. She nods to <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> to push one of the leaders further forward. A stream of fire coming from <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade> sets the man aflame before he is torn apart and eaten by both dragons. Daenerys suggests that the dragons may determine the innocence of the captives and touches <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade>'s back as if she wanted to push him but then she pretends she wants not to overfeed the dragons and lets the rest of the men be led away.
<entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> wakes up later with <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> sitting beside him. He asks if <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> survived the attack by the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> but <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> shakes her head. <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> thinks he has failed Ser Barristan, his men and Daenerys -- a claim <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> denies. <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> tells him he shouldn't be ashamed for being wounded given that he was ambushed and outnumbered, but <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> says he is ashamed that he was afraid when he was stabbed. <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> says that everyone fears death. However, <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> says it isn't death he fears, it is the thought of never getting to see <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> again that terrified him. <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> is noticeably touched and kisses <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade>.
Daenerys asks <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> whether she should reopen the fighting pits. <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> only says that she has seen Daenerys listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong. Daenerys visits the imprisoned <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade>, who begs for his life. Daenerys tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits, but only for free men. She also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of Meereen to forge a bond with the people of the city, and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already. She leaves a very confused <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> to ponder that he will live, and that he will soon be Meereen's prince consort.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>
    <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade>  Sam reads a note from Slaver's Bay to <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> updating him on Daenerys's situation. Sam praises Daenerys's courage but <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> worries about his great-niece's safety because she is all alone, under siege, and with hardly anyone to guide her, while her "last relation" is useless and dying thousands of miles away. <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> enters to speak with <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> in private. He needs the maester's advice on a controversial order that many of the Night's Watch will hate him for. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> tells Jon that half the men at <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade> already hate him, but that he should trust in his command. He says that Jon will not enjoy being Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade>, but with luck, he may find the strength to do what needs to be done. Jon is told to "kill the boy, and let the man be born."
Jon then meets with <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund Giantsbane</entidade> and offers to forge an alliance with the wildlings, bidding Tormund to go north of the wall and rally them all. He will open the gates for them and give them land south of the wall in which to settle. In return, the wildlings will fight alongside the Night’s Watch when <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> arrive. Tormund is initially reluctant and to convince him, Jon unlocks his chains, freeing him. Tormund relents, and reveals that most of the wildlings are up at <entidade:Hardhome>Hardhome</entidade>. Jon offers him horses and men to bring the wildlings back. Tormund tells him that they’ll need ships to bring his people back, which Jon says he’ll borrow from <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>. Tormund's final condition is that Jon accompany him as a guarantee that the wildlings will not fall prey to any traps set by the Night's Watch.
The men of the Night’s Watch do not take news of the alliance well, citing the countless innocent lives lost due to the wildlings. Even Jon’s friend Edd rejects this decision, stating that the wildlings killed their friends <entidade:Grenn>Grenn</entidade> and <entidade:Pypar>Pyp</entidade>. Nevertheless, Jon decides to go ahead with his plan. In the library, Sam tells <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> about his wish to go to <entidade:Citadel>Citadel</entidade> and become a maester before he was sent to the Night’s Watch, when <entidade:<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> walks in. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> reminisces about how Sam’s father, <entidade:Randyll Tarly>Randyll Tarly</entidade>, defeated <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of Ashford. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> wants to know how Sam killed the White Walker and Sam tells him how he did it with a dagger made of dragonglass. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> muses that it is abundantly available in <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>. Sam has been researching dragonglass and how it can kill <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, but has yet to come up with anything. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> tells him to continue his research and leaves.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> tells Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> that they will march toward <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> the next morning. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> suggests waiting until Jon returns with the wildlings, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> decides against it, as any delay improves the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>' chances. He also wants to take <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> and Shireen with them, as he does not think they will be safe at the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, surrounded by criminals. The next morning, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>’s army, with <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> at its head, starts its journey to <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>.

In the North
<entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of Tarth and <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade>, still pursuing <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>, arrive at an inn near <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>. Podrick thinks that Sansa may be better off at <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> now that she is far away from the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, but <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> believes that Sansa will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother - the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>. Their conversation is interrupted by a servant. Correctly suspecting that he is still loyal to the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> tells of her allegiance to <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> and convinces the servant to get a message through to Sansa – her presence still being something of a secret, the old servant seems to gain strength from the idea of a surviving Stark.
In <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, Ramsay <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> and his bedwarmer <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> discuss Ramsay’s upcoming marriage to Sansa. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> admits her jealousy of Sansa, especially since he had promised to marry <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> back when he was a bastard. Ramsay disregards <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>’s insecurities, causing <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> to proclaim that perhaps she will marry too. Ramsay is angered and violently tells her that she is his and she is not going anywhere unless she continues to bore him with her jealousy. He threateningly reminds her what he does to people who bore him, and hearing this <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> swears never to bore him again.
Meanwhile, Sansa’s maid carries a message to her. Consoling Sansa that she still has allies in the North, she tells Sansa to light a candle in the highest window of the <entidade:Broken <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade>>Broken <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade></entidade> if she ever needs help. As Sansa wanders around the castle, coming to the tower where <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade> pushed her brother <entidade:Brandon>Brandon</entidade> out of the window, she runs into <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade>. <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> puts on a friendly façade, talking to Sansa about her mother’s demise. To help Sansa “remember” how things used to be, <entidade:Myranda>Myranda</entidade> leads Sansa down to the kennels, where she finds <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>, formerly Theon Greyjoy, asleep in one of the cages. <entidade:Awoken>Awoken</entidade> by Sansa’s arrival, he just shakes his head, when Sansa calls him "Theon." He warns her that she shouldn't be down there. Seeing <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> in such a pitiful condition, Sansa angrily storms away.

    Sansa at the "family" dinner.  As <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> helps Ramsay get ready for dinner, he confesses to Ramsay that earlier that day, Sansa saw him in his cage. Ramsay, for his own amusement, makes it seem as though he’s going to punish <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> severely, before simply forgiving him. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> dinner, Ramsay is initially well-behaved, toasting his wedding to Sansa, but is soon back to his old ways as he forces <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> to apologize to Sansa for murdering <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>. With much difficulty, <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> finally mutters an apology. Ramsay then suggests that <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade> be the one to give Sansa away at the wedding, since he is the closest thing Sansa has to kin and <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> accepts the suggestion. Seeing that Ramsay is getting complacent, however, <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> has <entidade:Walda Bolton>Walda</entidade> announce that she is pregnant with a boy. Ramsay is clearly distressed by the news, which in turn delights Sansa.
    <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> tells Ramsay about his conception.  
After dinner, Ramsay expresses his distress at the possibility of the unborn child jeopardizing his claim on the North. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> reprimands his son for disgracing himself at dinner but seemingly dismisses his concern. He then shares the story of Ramsay’s birth; <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> raped a miller’s wife, who had married without his consent, after hanging her husband. A year later, she showed up with Ramsay, claiming that the baby was his. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> nearly had her whipped and the baby drowned, but when <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> laid eyes upon Ramsay, he was convinced that he was his son and decided to keep him. He then reveals to Ramsay that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> has an army at <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> plans to take the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade> and the road to King’s <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> passes through <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, which means that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> also intends to take the North. He wants Ramsay’s help in defeating <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, and Ramsay agrees.

<entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> Valyria
    <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and Jorah are attacked by the <entidade:Stonemen>Stonemen</entidade>  
As Jorah and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> continue their journey to Meereen, and following Jorah's violent reaction to a previous conversation, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are. As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> Valyria, a shorter route to Meereen and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria's reputation. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is apprehensive, but still excited to see the ruins of what was once the greatest civilization in the world.
As they catch glimpses of domes, towers and aqueducts, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> recites a poem about the Doom of Valyria, with Jorah joining in at the end. Suddenly, through the fog, they see <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> fly into view. Although he had been hearing about the dragons for some time, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is still utterly gobsmacked to see one in person. Jorah is struck silent too, as <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> is even bigger and more majestic than when he left. So distracted are they that they don't notice when the statues on a nearby aqueduct stand up and leap at the boat: they are <entidade:Stone Men>Stone Men</entidade> - victims of greyscale so far gone that they have been sent to live out the rest of their lives in quarantine in the ruins. Jorah tells <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> not to let them touch him and fights them off.  However, as <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is tied up, he is cornered at one end of the boat with a stone man advancing on him while Jorah battles more at the other end.  Just before the stone man is able to grab him, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> rolls off of the boat and into the water to escape, where he is then pulled down by more stone men under the water.
An undetermined amount of time later, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> wakes up and finds himself on a shore, dragged out of the water by Jorah. After confirming to each other that they had not been touched by the stone men, Jorah tells <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that he hopes to find a fishing village and get a boat soon, otherwise they'll have to walk all the way around Slaver's Bay to eventually reach Meereen. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> seems up for it and Jorah goes to look for firewood so they can make camp. However, once out of <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s view, he pulls back his sleeve to inspect the cracked skin on his wrist, confirming that he had been infected with greyscale during the fight with the stone men. He looks at <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and then glances in the direction of Meereen, knowing that even if he dies, he needs to get <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to Daenerys.
