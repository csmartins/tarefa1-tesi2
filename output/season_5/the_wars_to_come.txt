<entidade:Prologue>Prologue</entidade> - about 25 years ago, In the <entidade:Westerlands>Westerlands</entidade>
    <entidade:Young Cersei>Young Cersei</entidade> and <entidade:Melara Hetherspoon>Melara</entidade>, in the <entidade:Prologue>Prologue</entidade> flashback  
A young <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> and her wary tag-along <entidade:<entidade:Melara Hetherspoon>Melara</entidade> Hetherspoon><entidade:Melara Hetherspoon>Melara</entidade> Hetherspoon</entidade> are creeping through the woods of the <entidade:Westerlands>Westerlands</entidade>. <entidade:Melara Hetherspoon>Melara</entidade> doesn't want to continue, but young Cersei eggs her on. They reach a hut within the woods, which belongs to a <entidade:Woods>Woods</entidade> witch named <entidade:Maggy>Maggy</entidade>. <entidade:Unafraid>Unafraid</entidade>, Cersei walks in first. Upon meeting this "witch," Cersei demands to have her future read. <entidade:Maggy>Maggy</entidade> is hesitant at first, but after Cersei threatens to have her eyes gouged out, the witch relents. She says she will need a drop of Cersei's blood, so Cersei pricks her finger on a dagger. <entidade:Maggy>Maggy</entidade> tastes her blood and offers the young girl three questions. Cersei's first question was if she will marry the prince. <entidade:Maggy>Maggy</entidade> says she will not marry the prince, though she will marry the king, and become queen. She then asks if she and the king will have children, and <entidade:Maggy>Maggy</entidade> tells her that the king will have twenty children, but she will have three: gold will be their crowns - and gold their burial shrouds (indicating that all three will predecease their mother). Finally, she tells Cersei that her reign will not last: she will be queen, but eventually a younger and more beautiful queen is fated to take her place, along with everything she holds dear.

    Cersei kissing her deceased father <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>.  
In the present, Cersei arrives at the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> to pay respect to her deceased father <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>. Once inside the Sept, she chastises her brother Jaime for freeing their brother <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and indirectly causing their father's death. At <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>'s wake, Cersei is approached by <entidade:Lancel Lannister>Lancel Lannister</entidade>. He has become a devout member of the <entidade:Sparrows>Sparrows</entidade>, a religious cult, and asks Cersei's forgiveness for their adulterous relationship, as well as getting her husband <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> obscenely drunk on the day he died. Cersei denies any knowledge of her husband's murder, and shrugs off Lancel.

    Loras in bed with <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade>.  
While in bed together, Loras and the male prostitute <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> contemplate a birthmark on Loras's thigh which looks a little like <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>. Margaery walks in on them, complains about his lack of discretion and sends <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> away. Loras retorts that since his sexuality is an open secret anyway, there isn't much point in discretion. He also opines that as <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> is dead, no one will force Cersei to marry him anymore. He points out how this will leave Cersei in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, free to harass Margaery. Margaery simply replies with "perhaps."

In the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade></entidade>
    In <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> speaks to <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> about his future.  
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> arrives in <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade>, with the aid of <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> tells <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he and <entidade:Illyrio Mopatis>Illyrio Mopatis</entidade> had worked together in secret to restore <entidade:House Targaryen>House Targaryen</entidade> to the rule of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, but that their errors have left them in <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade>, unable to return to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> has descended into bitterness and self-loathing, seemingly determined to drink himself to death, but <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> angrily snaps him out of his self pity, telling <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> that he still has talents that may yet be of use; talents that he could use to seat the right candidate on the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> states that <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> is mired in chaos and on the brink of ruin; the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> requires a ruler, one stronger than Tommen yet gentler than <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, beloved by the people, able to please the common folk and keep the nobility in line. When <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> retorts that such a man does not exist, <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> points out that he never said this ruler would be a man. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> offers <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> the choice of either drinking himself to death in <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade>, or travelling with him to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> to support Daenerys Targaryen. After a moment, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> agrees.

In <entidade:Slavers Bay>Slaver</entidade>'s Bay
The <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> remove the large gold harpy from the top of the <entidade:Great Pyramid>Great Pyramid</entidade> in <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> to show the <entidade:Meereenese>Meereenese</entidade> people they are under Targaryen rule now and their old traditions are gone. <entidade:One>One</entidade> of the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Rat><entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Rat</entidade>, is seen walking into a brothel and pays a prostitute to lie with him and comfort him. He is subsequently murdered by a member of the Sons of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>, a resistance group operating in <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>. Upon being presented with the murderer's mask (left at the scene), Daenerys orders <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> to find those responsible, and for the murdered soldier to be buried in the <entidade:Temple>Temple</entidade> of the <entidade:Graces>Graces</entidade> as a statement.

    <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> attempts to visit her dragons.  
<entidade:<entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade>><entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade> return to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> and declare that their mission to <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> has been successful, and that the <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise Masters</entidade> will turn over power to a council of former slaves and former slave owners. In exchange, the <entidade:Wise Masters>Wise Masters</entidade> have asked that Daenerys consent to the reopening of the fighting pits, an arena where slaves used to fight to the death. Daenerys denies the request. Later, Daario convinces her to reconsider, as his youth fighting in the pits gave him the fighting skills necessary for him to join the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>, where he met Daenerys. Upon hearing that <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> hasn't been seen in weeks, Daario muses on the irony of a dragon-queen with no dragons.
Later, Daenerys attempts to visit <entidade:Viserion>Viserion</entidade> and <entidade:Rhaegal>Rhaegal</entidade>, whom she locked underground in the <entidade:Meereenese>Meereenese</entidade> catacombs to prevent them from killing innocents or fleeing (both of which <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> did). When she approaches them, they attempt to attack her, forcing her to briskly escape the room.

In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>
    <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>, Sansa, <entidade:Sweetrobin Arryn>Sweetrobin Arryn</entidade>, and <entidade:Lord Royce>Lord Royce</entidade> at <entidade:Runestone>Runestone</entidade> in the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>.  
<entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> and Sansa watch over Lord <entidade:Robin Arryn>Robin Arryn</entidade>'s struggles while sparring with another young boy. While watching Robin spar, Sansa witnesses Baelish receive a message, which he quickly hides. <entidade:Lord Yohn>Lord Yohn</entidade> Royce has agreed to take Robin as his ward and train him to fight, but is not optimistic of his abilities, stating "he swings a sword like a girl with palsy." Though <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> told <entidade:Lord Royce>Lord Royce</entidade> that he and Sansa would be traveling to the <entidade:Fingers>Fingers</entidade>, they instead head west. Sansa asks if they have anything to fear from <entidade:Lord Yohn>Lord Yohn</entidade>; <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> explains that he doesn't trust the retainers and soldiers who saw them, and is taking Sansa somewhere the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> will never find her.
<entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade> attempts to plan the next move for himself and <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade>, but <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> tells him that she doesn't want anyone following her. He reminds her of the oath she swore to Jaime to find the Stark girls, but she states that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> did not want her protection. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> also points out that Pod was not safe in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> and now that they are far away from the capital, he is safe and they can go their separate ways. <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> and Sansa's carriage passes them, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> unaware of how close her goal is.

At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    Jon relay's <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' offer to Mance.  
<entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>'s attempts at training <entidade:Olly>Olly</entidade> are interrupted by <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>, who has been sent to fetch Jon for an audience with <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>. On the ride to the top of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, Jon is discomfited by <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s presence and questions. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> explains that he intends to retake the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> from Lord Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, but needs an army, and desires the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Folk>Folk</entidade></entidade> to fight for him. He wants Jon to convince <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade> to bend the knee and have the wildlings fight for him; in exchange, he would set them free and give them their own land within <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. Jon relays this message to Mance, but he refuses to bend the knee; to do so would be to show unforgivable weakness in the eyes of his people. Because he will not fight for <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, his punishment is death by being burned alive. On the night of his execution, Mance stands before <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>, and although he cannot bend the knee, he offers him luck in the wars to come. Mance is led to the stake. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> lights the pyre, and Mance slowly begins to feel the agonizing pain of the fire. Unable to watch him suffer any longer, Jon turns and storms off. Others turn away from the scene as well, including <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> and Shireen. Just as Mance begins to give in and start screaming, an arrow pierces his chest. It is shot by Jon, giving the man he respected an easier death. Mance dies before he feels the agony of the flames.
