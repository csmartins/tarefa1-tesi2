Arya arrives in <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>. Pod and <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> run into trouble on the road. Cersei fears for her daughter's safety in <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> as <entidade:<entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> Sand><entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> Sand</entidade> seeks revenge for <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>'s death. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> tempts Jon. An adviser tempts <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>.


In the <entidade:Free Cities>Free Cities</entidade>
    Arya turned away from the House of Black and White.   <entidade:Ternesio Terys>Ternesio Terys</entidade> and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade> arrive at <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, and Arya is at first scared by the horn blown by the man inside the Titan of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>. The two then arrive at the House of Black and White on a boat. Arya lingers outside waiting for admittance, but is rejected by an elder man despite showing the coin <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>'ghar had given her and mentioning their prior association. Arya waits outside the House for days, endlessly reciting the names of the people she's going to kill, but eventually tosses away her coin and wanders off into the streets of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>. While hunting for pigeons, she encounters several thugs who threaten to take her food and <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade>. As she prepares to defend herself, the boys scatter when the man from the House of Black and White appears again. After following him back to the House, Arya demands he divulge his identity, and he returns to her the coin she threw in the water before. His face morphs into that of the man Arya knew as <entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade>. Stating that "a man is not <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>'ghar," he responds to Arya's question as to who he really is with the answer "No one. And that is what a girl must become" as he indicates that Arya may now enter the House.
Further south, <entidade:<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> depart <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> in a large wheelhouse pulled by many horses. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> remains despondent, and as he promised, he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> explains that they are travelling to Meereen by way of Volantis. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> points out that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was an effective ruler when he was acting <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King, and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities (a eunuch and a dwarf). They enjoyed accumulating power, he says, but they also wall themselves off from other people, like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now - but deep down they were never satisfied being separate from society. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is unmoved from his depression, and continues to insist that he's tired of being confined in a box of some sort. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> again warns him that he must remain hidden and that it is unsafe to be seen publicly: Cersei has promised a lordship to any man who brings her his head. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> scoffs and rhetorically asks if Cersei is going to kill every dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him....

In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and the Crownlands
In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> is presented with the severed head of yet another dwarf. Her offer of a lordship for <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s head has indeed motivated people to start killing any dwarf they can find and try to pass it off as <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. Cersei is irate, but won't punish the men who brought her the head for fear this will deter other such bounty hunters. She wants the head disposed of, but <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> interjects and politely asks if he can keep the head, as it might be of use in some of his "experiments."

    Cersei shows Jaime the "gift" from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>.   Cersei summons Jaime to their late father's office and reveals a "gift" from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>: an ornately carved viper, with Princess Myrcella's unique Lannister pendant suspended from its fangs. She insists it is a threat against Myrcella, a conclusion Jaime can't refute. Cersei lashes out at Jaime for not being a father to any of his children, to which he points out that if he had been, their children would be stoned in the streets. He declares he will fix the situation with Myrcella and ignores Cersei's mocking of his one-handed status.
That issue dealt with, Cersei convenes the <entidade:Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade>>Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade></entidade>. Sitting in the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>'s seat, she announces that "<entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>" has declared <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> the new Master of Whisperers and that the position of <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King will remain vacant until <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> is old enough to decide on a candidate for himself. <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade> has apparently also decided to make <entidade:<entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> Tyrell><entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> Tyrell</entidade> the new Master of Coin in addition to his duties as Master of Ships, and extends the (just now made up) position of "Master of <entidade:War>War</entidade>" to <entidade:<entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> Lannister</entidade>. Although <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace</entidade> preens at his new responsibilities, <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> is outraged at <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade>'s promotion (as he was thrown out of the order of Maesters for conducting human experimentation). <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan</entidade> is disgusted at Cersei's blatant power play. Refusing the new position, he denounces Cersei as nothing more than the Queen <entidade:Mother>Mother</entidade>, berates her for abusing her authority to fill the <entidade:Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade>>Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade></entidade> with her sycophants. He then walks out, saying he will await King <entidade:Tommen Baratheon>Tommen</entidade>'s own instructions - at <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>.
Further north in the Crownlands at <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Stokeworth><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Stokeworth</entidade>, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed <entidade:<entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> Stokeworth><entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> Stokeworth</entidade>. They seem to get on relatively well, but when <entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> reminds <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> that her older sister will get the castle when their mother dies, he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what's coming to them, clearly setting his sights on the castle. Jaime finds the couple, and reveals to <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> that Cersei has reneged on her deal and offered <entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade>'s hand to Ser <entidade:Willas Bracken>Willas Bracken</entidade> instead. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until Jaime tells him that if he helps rescue Myrcella from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> will receive a much better girl than <entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade>, who has rights to a much better castle.

In <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>
    <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> and Doran discuss <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade>'s death.   In the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade> of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> Sand><entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> Sand</entidade> rudely demands an audience with <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran Martell</entidade>, the ruling <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>. His bodyguard, <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade>, blocks her path, yet Doran tells him to let her pass. She wants to take Princess Myrcella, who at that very moment is enjoying <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane Martell</entidade>'s company, so that she can send the princess piece by piece to Cersei as revenge for <entidade:<entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> Martell><entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> Martell</entidade>'s murder. Doran refuses, reminding her that <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn</entidade> had participated in a trial by combat, and therefore his death was legal, and not murder. He states <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> will not stoop to the level of mutilating children while he rules, even if the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> are siding with <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade>. Sneering, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria</entidade> asks how long he expects to rule for and storms out. Hotah and the <entidade:Prince>Prince</entidade> exchange a look as she departs, the former meaningfully indicating his axe, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade> as he contemplates his next move.
In the Vale
<entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick arrive at an inn and dine. Podrick spots <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> with <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade>, and <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> tells him to ready the horses and she confronts them. 

    <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> swears to Sansa.  
<entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> mentions her sworn vow to Sansa's mother Catelyn, while <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> points out how she was accused of murdering <entidade:<entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> Baratheon</entidade> and how both he and Catelyn are now dead. Sansa denies <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>'s request and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> urges that she stay at the inn as the road is not safe, and seeing this as a trap, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> escapes with Podrick on the horses they take. They are chased through a forest as <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> fights the men and Podrick is thrown off his horse. Reuniting, Podrick mentions how both Stark girls denied her request for protection, but <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> retorts by doubting Sansa is safe with <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> tells Podrick to get his horse as they attempt to further pursue Sansa and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>.

In Meereen
    <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> tells Daenarys the truth about her father, the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade>.   <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> find a house belonging to a Son of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> allegedly responsible for <entidade:White Rat>White Rat</entidade>'s death. <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> explains that he has been using the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> as spies throughout Meereen, since they are far less conspicuous than Unsullied and can indulge in the same vices as their informants; <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> indicates his men's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall, seriously injuring the man hiding behind it.
Back at the <entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Pyramid, Daenerys and her council debate executing this <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>'s Son, but the debate devolves into a shouting match between <entidade:Mossador>Mossador</entidade> and <entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade>. After the rest leave, Ser Barristan tells her about her father, and confirms that, contrary to what <entidade:Viserys>Viserys</entidade> told her, the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade> was indeed quite mad, citing how his crimes against <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade> ultimately led to the rebellion that all but destroyed the <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> dynasty. <entidade:Mollified>Mollified</entidade> by the revelation, particularly that her crazed father always thought his atrocities were serving justice to his enemies, Daenerys promises Ser Barristan that there will be a trial for the accused. Before the trial begins, <entidade:Mossador>Mossador</entidade> kills the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>'s Son. Daenerys, hoping to preserve the integrity of law, has <entidade:Mossador>Mossador</entidade> publicly executed, causing the freed slaves to hiss at her and throw rocks at her as she leaves, along with a riot between the former slaves and masters breaking out.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night, Daenerys dismisses her council and goes outside. To her relief, <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade>, now the size of a small house, has alighted just above her balcony. <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> sniffs her outstretched hand, and though he doesn't attack, he flies away again, leaving his mother alone.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen Baratheon</entidade> teaches <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> how to read in <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>'s library, apparently to Sam's chagrin. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> asks about Shireen's <entidade:Greyscale>Greyscale</entidade> scars, revealing that the wildlings don't really have a word for it and that two of her sisters contracted and were driven mad by the disease, before Craster put them out of their misery. Queen <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> interrupts the proceedings and dismisses Sam and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade>. She lectures Shireen on the dangers of spending time with any wildlings, since they could conceivably use <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> to harm <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> through Shireen. Shireen, however, doubts that that's how things will go.

    "<entidade:Bear>Bear</entidade> Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark." - <entidade:<entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> Mormont><entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> Mormont</entidade>, ten year old <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> of <entidade:Bear>Bear</entidade> Island.  
<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> himself, meanwhile, discusses <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>'s recent defiance. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> shows Jon a message he received from <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> Mormont><entidade:Lyanna Mormont>Lyanna</entidade> Mormont</entidade> in response to the demand that House Mormont pledge itself to <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>' cause. The note refuses, saying that the Mormonts know only one king, the King in the North, and will only follow a Stark. Jon tells <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> that, like the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade>, the <entidade:Northeners>Northerners</entidade> will only follow one of their own. Realizing this is true, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> makes Jon an enticing offer: if he leaves the Night's Watch, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark, Lord of <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, so he can rally the North to <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>'s side and resume the fight against the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>, <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade>, and <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>. Jon is visibly moved at the prospect of having his lifelong dream finally come true, but he later admits to Sam that he plans to turn <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> down: he is a man of the Night's Watch.
The election for the new Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the Night's Watch commences, overseen by <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade>. <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade> nominates <entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser Thorne</entidade>. Another brother names <entidade:Denys Mallister>Denys Mallister</entidade>, <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:<entidade:Shadow <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade>>Shadow</entidade> <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade>><entidade:Shadow <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade>>Shadow</entidade> <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade></entidade>. The vote almost begins before Sam interrupts to put forward a third nomination: <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>. When the votes are cast, a tie is called: Snow and Thorne have garnered an equal number of votes. With a wry smile, <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> casts his own vote for <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade>. The black brothers hail Jon as the 998th Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the Night's Watch.
