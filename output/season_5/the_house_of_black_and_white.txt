<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> arrives in <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>. Pod and <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> run into trouble on the road. Cersei fears for her daughter's safety in <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> as <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade> seeks revenge for Oberyn's death. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> tempts Jon. An adviser tempts <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade>.


In the <entidade:Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade>>Free <entidade:Free Cities>Cities</entidade></entidade>
    <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> turned away from the <entidade:House of Black>House of Black</entidade> and <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade>.   <entidade:Ternesio Terys>Ternesio Terys</entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> arrive at <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is at first scared by the horn blown by the man inside the <entidade:Titan of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>>Titan of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade></entidade>. The two then arrive at the <entidade:House of Black>House of Black</entidade> and <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> on a boat. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> lingers outside waiting for admittance, but is rejected by an elder man despite showing the coin <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade> had given her and mentioning their prior association. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> waits outside the House for days, endlessly reciting the names of the people she's going to kill, but eventually tosses away her coin and wanders off into the streets of <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>. While hunting for pigeons, she encounters several thugs who threaten to take her food and <entidade:Needle>Needle</entidade>. As she prepares to defend herself, the boys scatter when the man from the <entidade:House of Black>House of Black</entidade> and <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> appears again. After following him back to the House, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> demands he divulge his identity, and he returns to her the coin she threw in the water before. His face morphs into that of the man <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> knew as <entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade>. Stating that "a man is not <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade>," he responds to <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s question as to who he really is with the answer "No one. And that is what a girl must become" as he indicates that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> may now enter the House.
Further south, <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> depart <entidade:Pentos>Pentos</entidade> in a large wheelhouse pulled by many horses. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> remains despondent, and as he promised, he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> explains that they are travelling to <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade> by way of <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> points out that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was an effective ruler when he was acting <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King, and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities (a eunuch and a dwarf). They enjoyed accumulating power, he says, but they also wall themselves off from other people, like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now - but deep down they were never satisfied being separate from society. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is unmoved from his depression, and continues to insist that he's tired of being confined in a box of some sort. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> again warns him that he must remain hidden and that it is unsafe to be seen publicly: Cersei has promised a lordship to any man who brings her his head. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> scoffs and rhetorically asks if Cersei is going to kill every dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him....

In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> and the <entidade:Crownlands>Crownlands</entidade>
In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> is presented with the severed head of yet another dwarf. Her offer of a lordship for <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s head has indeed motivated people to start killing any dwarf they can find and try to pass it off as <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>. Cersei is irate, but won't punish the men who brought her the head for fear this will deter other such bounty hunters. She wants the head disposed of, but <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> interjects and politely asks if he can keep the head, as it might be of use in some of his "experiments."

    Cersei shows Jaime the "gift" from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>.   Cersei summons Jaime to their late father's office and reveals a "gift" from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>: an ornately carved viper, with <entidade:Princess Myrcella>Princess Myrcella</entidade>'s unique Lannister pendant suspended from its fangs. She insists it is a threat against Myrcella, a conclusion Jaime can't refute. Cersei lashes out at Jaime for not being a father to any of his children, to which he points out that if he had been, their children would be stoned in the streets. He declares he will fix the situation with Myrcella and ignores Cersei's mocking of his one-handed status.
That issue dealt with, Cersei convenes the Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade>. Sitting in the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>'s seat, she announces that "Tommen" has declared <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> the new <entidade:Master of Whisperers>Master of Whisperers</entidade> and that the position of <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King will remain vacant until Tommen is old enough to decide on a candidate for himself. Tommen has apparently also decided to make <entidade:Mace Tyrell>Mace Tyrell</entidade> the new <entidade:Master of Coin>Master of Coin</entidade> in addition to his duties as <entidade:Master of Ships>Master of Ships</entidade>, and extends the (just now made up) position of "Master of <entidade:War>War</entidade>" to <entidade:Kevan Lannister>Kevan Lannister</entidade>. Although Mace preens at his new responsibilities, <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> is outraged at <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade>'s promotion (as he was thrown out of the order of Maesters for conducting human experimentation). Kevan is disgusted at Cersei's blatant power play. Refusing the new position, he denounces Cersei as nothing more than the <entidade:Queen <entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade>>Queen <entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade></entidade>, berates her for abusing her authority to fill the Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade> with her sycophants. He then walks out, saying he will await <entidade:King Tommen>King Tommen</entidade>'s own instructions - at <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>.
Further north in the <entidade:<entidade:Crownlands>Crownlands</entidade> at Castle Stokeworth><entidade:Crownlands>Crownlands</entidade> at Castle Stokeworth</entidade>, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed <entidade:<entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> Stokeworth><entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> Stokeworth</entidade>. They seem to get on relatively well, but when <entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade> reminds <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> that her older sister will get the castle when their mother dies, he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what's coming to them, clearly setting his sights on the castle. Jaime finds the couple, and reveals to <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> that Cersei has reneged on her deal and offered <entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade>'s hand to <entidade:Ser Willas Bracken>Ser Willas Bracken</entidade> instead. <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until Jaime tells him that if he helps rescue Myrcella from <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, <entidade:Ser Bronn>Bronn</entidade> will receive a much better girl than <entidade:Lollys Stokeworth>Lollys</entidade>, who has rights to a much better castle.

In <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>
    Ellaria and Doran discuss Oberyn's death.   In the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade> of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>, <entidade:Ellaria Sand>Ellaria Sand</entidade> rudely demands an audience with <entidade:Doran Martell>Doran Martell</entidade>, the ruling Prince of <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade>. His bodyguard, <entidade:Areo Hotah>Areo Hotah</entidade>, blocks her path, yet Doran tells him to let her pass. She wants to take <entidade:Princess Myrcella>Princess Myrcella</entidade>, who at that very moment is enjoying <entidade:Trystane Martell>Trystane Martell</entidade>'s company, so that she can send the princess piece by piece to Cersei as revenge for <entidade:Oberyn Martell>Oberyn Martell</entidade>'s murder. Doran refuses, reminding her that Oberyn had participated in a trial by combat, and therefore his death was legal, and not murder. He states <entidade:Dorne>Dorne</entidade> will not stoop to the level of mutilating children while he rules, even if the <entidade:Sand Snakes>Sand Snakes</entidade> are siding with Ellaria. Sneering, Ellaria asks how long he expects to rule for and storms out. Hotah and the Prince exchange a look as she departs, the former meaningfully indicating his axe, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the <entidade:Water Gardens>Water Gardens</entidade> as he contemplates his next move.
In the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade>
<entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> and Podrick arrive at an inn and dine. Podrick spots <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> with <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade> Baelish, and <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> tells him to ready the horses and she confronts them. 

    <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> swears to Sansa.  
<entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> mentions her sworn vow to Sansa's mother Catelyn, while <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> points out how she was accused of murdering <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly Baratheon</entidade> and how both he and Catelyn are now dead. Sansa denies <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade>'s request and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> urges that she stay at the inn as the road is not safe, and seeing this as a trap, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> escapes with Podrick on the horses they take. They are chased through a forest as <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> fights the men and Podrick is thrown off his horse. Reuniting, Podrick mentions how both Stark girls denied her request for protection, but <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> retorts by doubting Sansa is safe with <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> tells Podrick to get his horse as they attempt to further pursue Sansa and <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>.

In <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>
    <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> tells <entidade:Daenarys>Daenarys</entidade> the truth about her father, the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade>.   Daario and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> find a house belonging to a Son of the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade> allegedly responsible for <entidade:<entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Rat><entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Rat</entidade>'s death. Daario explains that he has been using the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> as spies throughout <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, since they are far less conspicuous than <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> and can indulge in the same vices as their informants; Daario indicates his men's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall, seriously injuring the man hiding behind it.
Back at the <entidade:Great Pyramid>Great Pyramid</entidade>, Daenerys and her council debate executing this <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>'s Son, but the debate devolves into a shouting match between <entidade:Mossador>Mossador</entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade>><entidade:Hizdahr>Hizdahr</entidade> zo <entidade:Loraq>Loraq</entidade></entidade>. After the rest leave, <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> tells her about her father, and confirms that, contrary to what <entidade:Viserys Targaryen>Viserys</entidade> told her, the <entidade:<entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King><entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King</entidade> was indeed quite mad, citing how his crimes against <entidade:House Stark>House Stark</entidade> ultimately led to the rebellion that all but destroyed the Targaryen dynasty. Mollified by the revelation, particularly that her crazed father always thought his atrocities were serving justice to his enemies, Daenerys promises <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> that there will be a trial for the accused. Before the trial begins, <entidade:Mossador>Mossador</entidade> kills the <entidade:Harpy>Harpy</entidade>'s Son. Daenerys, hoping to preserve the integrity of law, has <entidade:Mossador>Mossador</entidade> publicly executed, causing the freed slaves to hiss at her and throw rocks at her as she leaves, along with a riot between the former slaves and masters breaking out.
Later that night, Daenerys dismisses her council and goes outside. To her relief, <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade>, now the size of a small house, has alighted just above her balcony. <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> sniffs her outstretched hand, and though he doesn't attack, he flies away again, leaving his mother alone.

At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen Baratheon</entidade> teaches <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> how to read in <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>'s library, apparently to <entidade:Sam's>Sam's</entidade> chagrin. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> asks about <entidade:Shireen's>Shireen's</entidade> <entidade:Greyscale>Greyscale</entidade> scars, revealing that the wildlings don't really have a word for it and that two of her sisters contracted and were driven mad by the disease, before <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade> put them out of their misery. <entidade:Queen <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade>>Queen <entidade:Queen Selyse>Selyse</entidade></entidade> interrupts the proceedings and dismisses Sam and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade>. She lectures Shireen on the dangers of spending time with any wildlings, since they could conceivably use <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> to harm <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> through Shireen. Shireen, however, doubts that that's how things will go.

    "<entidade:Old Bear>Bear</entidade> Island knows no king but the King in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, whose name is Stark." - <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, ten year old Lady of <entidade:Old Bear>Bear</entidade> Island.  
<entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> himself, meanwhile, discusses <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>'s recent defiance. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> shows Jon a message he received from Lady <entidade:Aunt Lyanna>Lyanna</entidade> <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> in response to the demand that House <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> pledge itself to <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' cause. The note refuses, saying that the <entidade:Mormonts>Mormonts</entidade> know only one king, the King in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, and will only follow a Stark. Jon tells <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> that, like the <entidade:Wildlings>Wildlings</entidade>, the <entidade:Northerners>Northerners</entidade> will only follow one of their own. Realizing this is true, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> makes Jon an enticing offer: if he leaves the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as <entidade:Jon Stark>Jon Stark</entidade>, Lord of <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, so he can rally the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> to <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>'s side and resume the fight against the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>, <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade>, and <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>. Jon is visibly moved at the prospect of having his lifelong dream finally come true, but he later admits to Sam that he plans to turn <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> down: he is a man of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>.
The election for the new <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> commences, overseen by <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade>. <entidade:Janos Slynt>Janos Slynt</entidade> nominates <entidade:<entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> Thorne><entidade:Alliser Thorne>Alliser</entidade> Thorne</entidade>. Another brother names <entidade:Denys Mallister>Denys Mallister</entidade>, Commander of the <entidade:Shadow Tower>Shadow Tower</entidade>. The vote almost begins before Sam interrupts to put forward a third nomination: <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>. When the votes are cast, a tie is called: <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade> and Thorne have garnered an equal number of votes. With a wry smile, <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade> casts his own vote for <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade>. The black brothers hail Jon as the 998th <entidade:Lord Commander>Lord Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>.
