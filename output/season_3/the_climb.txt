Summary
In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
In <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, Lord <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> meets with <entidade:Lady Olenna>Lady Olenna</entidade> Tyrell to discuss having <entidade:Ser Loras>Ser Loras</entidade> marry his daughter, Cersei. They trade barbs about Cersei's age, Cersei's capability to have more children, and accusations of incest with Jaime, as well as Loras's well-known homosexuality. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> is adamant that Cersei, whom he calls the Kingdom's most beautiful woman, should marry Loras, the Kingdom's most handsome and desired bachelor, but Olenna blatantly refuses to consent, hinting that Joffrey is the result of incest. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> replies that if that is true, he has no right to the throne and the <entidade:Tyrells>Tyrells</entidade> just "threw a flower into the dirt". Olenna says she will not risk "throwing another flower into the dirt" if Cersei cannot bear heirs for the <entidade:Tyrells>Tyrells</entidade>. Realizing her unchanged position on the matter, <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> threatens to make Loras a knight of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, which would force Loras to give up his right to marriage and to inherit <entidade:Highgarden>Highgarden</entidade>. Olenna relents, and consents to the marriage of Loras and Cersei.
In the gardens, <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> tries to get closer to Loras by discussing their hopefully impending wedding. Loras is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her, but brightens when discussing the lavish wedding he's had planned – although Sansa, for once, becomes suspicious when she realizes that Loras seems more excited by the food and the wedding joust than by her. Loras quickly placates her with a compliment and then describes the wedding gown he's envisioned for her. Sansa says she's looking forward to seeing <entidade:Highgarden>Highgarden</entidade>, as she's only ever lived in <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> and can't wait to leave <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. In this, Loras finds unexpected common ground with her and agrees that the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> is "the most terrible place there is".
Cersei and <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> observe the couple from Cersei's chambers overlooking the garden. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically asks which of the four of them has it the worst. He then finally accuses his sister of trying to have him killed during the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. Cersei, tired of fighting him, remains quiet while he deduces that only two people can command the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> realizes that while Cersei certainly has the authority to command a <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, she isn't stupid enough to command Ser Mandon Moore to kill him in public. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> realizes that it was in fact Joffrey who ordered <entidade:Ser Mandon>Ser Mandon</entidade> Moore to kill him, because <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was the only one who stood up to him. Cersei tells him his life is not in danger from Joffrey, as he dare not try anything like that now that <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> is the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade>. They discuss about Jaime's possible return to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, with Cersei wondering where he could possibly be. She asks <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> which one of them should be the one to break the news to Sansa.
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> decides he might as well dash Sansa's hopes sooner rather than later. He goes to Sansa's chamber and asks for a private word, but Sansa declines to dismiss <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> gives <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to Sansa.
Later on, <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade></entidade> finds <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Petyr>Petyr</entidade></entidade> Baelish in the throne room. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> and Baelish discuss the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade> and the pageantry and propaganda that creates nations and cements dynasties. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> asserts that he serves the realm, but Baelish scoffs that "the realm" is an invention of <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> the <entidade:Conqueror>Conqueror</entidade>. Baelish tells <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> that he is aware of <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade>' arrangement with Ros, and that he has given her to "a friend" who is eager for a new experience. Baelish revels in the chaos that he has caused, likening chaos to a ladder (for those brave enough to climb) rather than a pit to be lost in, as <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> and everyone else sees it.

    Joffrey kills Ros  
Elsewhere, Sansa weeps as Baelish's ship departs, both of her plans to leave <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> in tatters. Meanwhile, Joffrey coldly contemplates Ros's quarrel-ridden corpse.

In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, the hideout of the <entidade:<entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> without Banners><entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> without Banners</entidade> outside of <entidade:Hollow Hill>Hollow Hill</entidade>, <entidade:Anguy>Anguy</entidade> trains <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> with a bow.     <entidade:Anguy>Anguy</entidade> teaching <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> how to shoot a bow better.   <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> spots someone behind her target, which is revealed to be <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> and a small group of <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon's men. She speaks to <entidade:Thoros>Thoros</entidade> in <entidade:High Valyrian>High Valyrian</entidade>, demanding to know what became of his mission to convert <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade> to the worship of the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade>. He bluntly tells her he failed. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> is brought to the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade>'s hideout and is shocked when she learns of the six deaths of <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric Dondarrion</entidade>, exclaiming that <entidade:Thoros>Thoros</entidade> should not have that kind of power. <entidade:Thoros>Thoros</entidade> counters that he has no power, he only asks for favors and the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> sees fit to grant them. The priestess seems troubled by his response (or perhaps by the fact that the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> looks favorably on causes other than her own). <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> says the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> has someone the <entidade:Lord of Light>Lord of Light</entidade> needs, and soon after has her men take <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> into her custody. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> protests, particularly when she sees that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> has given the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> two heavy sacks of gold in exchange. She confronts the red priestess, calling her a witch. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> ignores the barb and looks into <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>'s eyes. She sees many other eyes, of many other colors- eyes that <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> will shut forever. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> abruptly tells her that they will meet again.
    <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> is enraged at having to marry Roslin  
At <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>, King <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade> and his advisors meet with "<entidade:Black Walder>Black Walder</entidade>" and <entidade:Lame Lothar>Lothar</entidade> Frey to discuss an alliance for his planned attack on <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>. The <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> carry <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade>'s demands for an alliance, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> and all of its lands and incomes, and for <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade> to marry Roslin, one of his daughters. <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced by the group to go through with the arrangement.

    Jaime and <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> discuss Jaime's release.  
At <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, Lord Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> has dinner with Jaime and <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade>. <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> tells Jaime he will send him to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade> as restitution for his lost hand but only on the condition that Jaime swear to tell his father that <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> was not personally responsible for maiming him. Jaime assumes that <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> will accompany him, but <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> intends to keep her with him, under arrest for abetting treason.
In the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, tensions rise at camp between <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> and Meera <entidade:House Reed>Reed</entidade> before <entidade:<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> diffuses the situation. <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> <entidade:House Reed>Reed</entidade> experiences a seizure while sleeping, and Meera explains they are caused by his visions. <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> then tells <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> that in his vision he saw <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> with the wildlings.

    Theon is tortured  Elsewhere, the cleaning boy awakens <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> to continue torturing him. The boy threatens to remove <entidade:Theon's>Theon's</entidade> pinky finger if he cannot guess the boy's true identity and their current location. He gives the impression that Theon guessed right when Theon says he is the younger brother of <entidade:Torrhen Karstark>Torrhen</entidade> <entidade:Harald Karstark>Karstark</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Rickard>Rickard</entidade> <entidade:Harald Karstark>Karstark</entidade>'s son, and that they are in <entidade:Karhold>Karhold</entidade>. But then, the boy tells Theon he was lying, and begins flaying <entidade:Theon's>Theon's</entidade> finger while telling him that he is torturing Theon only for his own amusement. 
<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> stop to camp during their journey to The <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> after having fled <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s Keep. Sam shows <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> the <entidade:Dragonglass>Dragonglass</entidade> dagger he found at the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade> of the <entidade:First Men>First</entidade> <entidade:Stone Men>Men</entidade> and tells her about <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>.

    Jon and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> kissing on the top of the wall  
At camp at the base of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, the wildling party led by <entidade:<entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane><entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane</entidade> prepare to climb. <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> talk about their impending climb and their relationship. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> reveals she is aware that Jon is still loyal to the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, but tells him he must be loyal to each other instead. While climbing, <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> strikes the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and causes a massive crack, which dislodges a large sheet of ice, sending several wildlings to their deaths. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> and Jon hang precariously by their safety rope. <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> decides that <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> cannot continue climbing with the weight of Jon and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>'s bodies pulling them down and begins cutting the rope. Jon sees what <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> is doing and barely manages to swing to his left and plant a hook in the ice, saving himself and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>. They reach the top of the wall, and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> is awed by the view beyond the wall and to the south, before she and Jon share a passionate kiss.
