Summary
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
After surviving the perilous climb of the Wall, Jon <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>, <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>, and the wildlings led by <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane make their way towards <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>  to await <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> Rayder's signal to begin the attack on the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>. Afterwards <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> confronts Orell about cutting his and Ygritte's rope loose on The <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, nearly killing the both of them in the process. Orell tells <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that he doesn't see <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> complaining about what happened because she is a wildling and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation, also telling <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her. During the journey through the woods, a clearly jealous Orell confronts Ygritte and says that he would be a better man for her than <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade>, while continuing to express his distrust in <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> also tries to persuade <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> that the wildlings' cause is doomed to failure, but she refuses to listen and points out that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is technically one of them; if it fails, so does he. She renews her passion for him and tells him bluntly that if they die, they die, but before they die they will live in each other.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
<entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> Targaryen's army marches on to the next great city of Slaver's Bay, <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>. She and <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> Selmy are confident they can take the city, given that Yunkai are famous for training bed slaves rather than soldiers.  Ser Jorah notes with wisdom however that Yunkai's defenders won't fight them in open battle, being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> army with guerrilla tactics. He also advises <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> that conquering <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. <entidade:Dany Dothraki>Dany</entidade> however is adamant on freeing the slaves of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>, who number in the hundreds of thousands. She orders Grey Worm to send a messenger to the city and inform Yunkai's slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>.
The <entidade:Yunkish>Yunkish</entidade> herald is carried into Daenerys's camp on a litter carried by slaves, along a road flanked by <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>. Missandei announces the newcomer as <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> mo <entidade:Eraz>Eraz</entidade>, one of the ruling "Wise Masters" of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> meets the man in her pavilion, flanked by her dragons who vie for her attention and fight over the pieces of meat she tosses to them; they also snarl at <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> when he gets too close. Razdal declares that <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> was an ancient civilization long before the rise of Valyria and that numerous armies throughout history have tried and failed to conquer it. However <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is not threatened, commenting that a hard-fought battle would give her <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> much needed practice. <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> tries a different tact, asserting there is no need for their factions to fight, that <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> is willing to overlook her attack on <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade> and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> exchange, they ask that <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> leave <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> in peace.
<entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> makes a counter-offer: she will spare the lives of <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> and the slave-masters of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> if every slave (men, women and children) in the city is set free, and given as much food, clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services. She warns that if her offer is rejected, <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> will be shown no mercy. <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> takes offense, promising that <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> will be more of a challenge for her than <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade> or <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade>, and threatens her with the retribution of Yunkai's "powerful friends" who he claims will take great pleasure in destroying her army and enslaving the survivors. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> that, Drogon and his siblings roar in anger; <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> protests that he was promised safe conduct, to which <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother. After the dragons prevent his slaves from reclaiming the chests of gold he brought with him, <entidade:Razdal>Razdal</entidade> storms out of the pavilion, muttering curses. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> tells <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> to find out more about Yunkai's "powerful friends" before she commits herself to an attack on the city.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
Traveling back from the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, a ship carrying Melisandre and <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> leaves King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> and passes through <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater Bay</entidade>. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> stares at the broken wrecks of Stannis's fleet destroyed by the wildfire, asserting that her presence might have turned the tide of battle. She questions <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> and is surprised to learn he is unaware of his father's real identity. As they pass by the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> reveals to <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> that he is <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> Baratheon's bastard son.
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> The <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, on their way to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark's party makes camp. Osha remains distrustful of Meera and <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> Reed and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. <entidade:Osha>Osha</entidade> bluntly refuses to go, explaining that she lost her husband, who then rose from the dead and tried to kill her. She rages that none of them understand what lies beyond the Wall and that there is nothing left for men there.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the camp of the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> Without <entidade:Banners>Banners</entidade>, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, disillusioned with the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> for selling <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>, takes an opportunity to escape and runs off into the night. Before she gets too far, however, she is snatched up by <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade>, who was lying in wait for her.
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, en route to The <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> Stark's army is forced to make camp, their progress delayed by heavy rain. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> warns them that the prickly Lord <entidade:Black Walder>Walder</entidade> Frey will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him, but <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> Tully points out that <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Frey</entidade> is getting the wedding he wanted; his sister counters that he is getting a wedding, but not the one he wanted, glaring at her son and his wife as she says so, pointing out that <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Frey</entidade> wanted one of his daughters wed to a king. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> retorts that <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> is the best match <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> Frey has been offered in its history. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night, as <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> and <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade> prepare for bed, she tells him she is pregnant with his child. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> is gladdened by the news.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> his prison, Theon Greyjoy is released from the cross to which he is chained by two beautiful girls. The women lay Theon down on a bed and then proceed to dramatically seduce him. They say repeatedly that they have heard that the heir to <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade> is well endowed and are hoping to get first hand experience. Theon is distrustful at first, fearing that this is another of his tormenter's tricks. Theon cannot help himself but be aroused when one of the women who has become naked straddles him and begins a rocking motion. Suddenly, the familiar horn sounds and the boy enters. Theon is terrified and tries to escape, but is struck hard on the head and is flung to the ground. The boy claims he too has heard about Theon's famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part. When the sadistic youth brandishes an odd knife, Theon realizes the boy means to remove his penis. <entidade:Horrified>Horrified</entidade>, Theon begs for mercy, but the boy quips that this is mercy as he's not killing Theon, merely altering him. Two large men hold a screaming Theon down while the boy moves in to castrate him.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, neither Sansa or Tyrion are particularly happy about their impending marriage. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> Tyrell consoles <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, reminding her that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is far from the worst <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> and that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> might be able to make her happy, given his skill as a lover. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, meanwhile, points out to <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that he can easily wed <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and get a son and heir from her to placate his father and keep having sex with Shae in private, thereby getting two women and a kingdom to rule for himself. However, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is concerned his mistress isn't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife, a mistress and the entire <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> despising him. <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> points out that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is wasting his time trying to be universally loved. Tyrion's fears prove accurate as <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister enters the throne room to answer a summons from <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>. After exchanging some false courtesy <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> asks why his grandson wished to see him. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> wants an update on what the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> has been doing. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> informs <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> that the king can attend any <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> meeting should he desire it. The boy king claims that he is too busy to attend said meetings and demands to know why the location of the council meetings has changed. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> says that he is holding the meeting in the <entidade:Broken Tower>Tower</entidade> of the <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> to save time. When <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> complains that he would have to climb too many steps should he wish to sit in on a small council meeting, Tywin silently ascends the steps to stand next to the throne, silently glares down at <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>, and then sardonically says he could arrange to have <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> carried. A disconcerted Joffrey changes the subject to <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> Targaryen; <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is surprised that <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> even knows about the exiled princess. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> admits the reports are apparently true that the last <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> is not only alive, but has successfully hatched the first live dragons the world has seen in almost two centuries. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is puzzled at why <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> doesn't think they should do anything about her, but <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> reminds <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> that the last <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> dragons were stunted inbred creatures who weren't a threat to anyone, and Daenerys' dragons are probably just curiosities at best, not grand weapons of war. Moreover, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> says that even if Daenerys' dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago, they are on the far side of the world and no threat to Joffrey's rule. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> also warns his grandson that he should heed his advisor's council on matters he does not comprehend. When <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> protests that he hasn't been counseled on anything, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> should he deem it necessary. Before taking his leave Tywin smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> squirming on the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. Their exchange leaves no doubt as to who is really ruling the kingdom.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, Jaime speaks one last time to Brienne before he leaves. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> remarks that he owes <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his hand. <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> tells <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> to repay his debt by keeping his pledge. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> promises that he will keep his word to return <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> Stark's daughters to her.
The next day, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> leaves <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> in the company of Qyburn (who is to accompany <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his Maester's chain restored through <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> Tywin's influence- <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> jokes that his father will make <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> Grand Maester if he grows <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> a new hand) and a number of <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> soldiers under the command of <entidade:Steelshanks>Steelshanks</entidade>, one of Lord Bolton's captains. <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> Bolton, who is also about to depart <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> for the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, under orders from <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, requests that <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> pass on his regards to Tywin; <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> asks that <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> do the same for him with <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>. <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade>, who has been left in charge of the castle in Bolton's absence, can't resist poking fun at the departing <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and sneers that he will 'take good care' of <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade>, though <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> doesn't rise to the bait.
When their party makes camp, as Qyburn checks Jaime's stump, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> questions how the former <entidade:Order Maesters>Maester</entidade> lost his chain. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is disgusted by this revelation, but <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> on how many he has killed compared to how many he's saved. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> responds that he has probably killed thousands, but he saved half a million lives when he killed the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> to save the population of King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, much to Qyburn's surprise.
<entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then asks about Brienne; <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> confirms that they sent a raven to her father, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Selwyn Tarth>Selwyn Tarth</entidade>, and he offered a ransom of 300 <entidade:Gold Dragons>Gold Dragons</entidade> for his daughter's safe return. However, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> refused the offer; still under the misapprehension that <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade> owns every sapphire mine in <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> is convinced <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Selwyn Tarth>Selwyn</entidade> is trying to cheat him. When <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> before they die in battle or winter, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, feeling guilty because his lie to protect <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> has invertantly placed her in greater danger, urges <entidade:Steelshanks>Steelshanks</entidade> to return to <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>. Though the man initially refuses, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> uses the promise of a reward and the threat of <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister's retribution to convince him to go back.
<entidade:Upon>Upon</entidade> arriving at <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is shocked and furious to find <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> and his cronies have thrown <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> into a bear pit, facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself, as they all mockingly sing The <entidade:Bear Island>Bear</entidade> and the <entidade:Maiden Fair>Maiden Fair</entidade>. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> orders <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants, but <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> dismisses the offer, getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> being torn apart. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> desperation, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> leaps into the pit to help her; before the bear can harm either of them, <entidade:Steelshanks>Steelshanks</entidade> shoots it with a crossbow, distracting the beast long enough for <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> and <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> to be pulled out of the pit. <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> tries to stop them from leaving, but <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> angrily tells him that <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> cares more about getting him back to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy, and backed up by <entidade:Steelshanks>Steelshanks</entidade> and his men, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> is unable to stop them. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then departs <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade> with his escort and <entidade:Brienne Tarth>Brienne</entidade> in tow.
