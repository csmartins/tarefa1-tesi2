Summary
<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> attacks a wight  
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> a prologue scene, shouts and sword clashes are heard in the darkness as the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> and their army of undead wights attack the men of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> off-screen in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade> of the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade>. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> is then seen alive, wandering through a blizzard in search of safety. He sees another man of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> up ahead but soon finds that he has been decapitated and his head placed in his own hands. Just then, a wight approaches <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> and is about to attack him with an axe when the direwolf <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> knocks it down. <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> continues to tear at its legs as it pulls itself forward inch by inch towards <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade>. The wight suddenly burst into flame, destroyed by a torch wielded by <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade>, killing it. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> has managed to rally the few dozen survivors out of his original three hundred men at the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade> of the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade>. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> is angry that <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> wasn't able to send off any messenger-ravens in the confusion of the attack. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> announces that they must retreat back to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, not simply to save their own lives but because <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> and the rest of <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> must be warned of the coming threat―otherwise everyone they've ever known will die.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> is led by <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> and the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade> into the main wildling camp in the <entidade:Frostfangs>Frostfangs</entidade> mountains. It is not simply an army camp - almost all of wildling society is on the move to escape the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, including women and children. As they enter the camp, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is shocked to see a real-life giant walk past. Many of the wildlings are surprised to see <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> in his all-black Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> clothing and shout "Crow!" at his approach. Several young boys pelt <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> with ice and small stones, but <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> shoos them away.

    <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Giant</entidade> carrying mammoth bones  
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is led into the tent of King-Beyond-the-Wall <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>, where the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade> explains that he is <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark's bastard son to a large man with a heavy beard who is eating chicken by the fire. He says that he doesn't care, but his interest is piqued on hearing that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> killed <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin Halfhand</entidade>. As they talk, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> kneels before the man, whom he assumes to be <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>, and calls him "Your Grace" as he would a king south of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. All the wildlings to burst into laughter; their society does not bother with such ceremony–and because the man actually isn't <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade>, but his lieutenant <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund Giantsbane</entidade>. <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> himself is an unassuming man sitting in a corner, who then introduces himself and tells <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> to stand, as no man kneels before another among the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade>, as they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture.
<entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> says he is glad that <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> killed <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin</entidade>, as he had killed many of Mance's wildlings, though he notes that <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin</entidade> was his brother once, back when he was a member of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> and <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin</entidade> had a whole hand. <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> asks <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> why he wants to join them. He replies that he wants to be free, but <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> thinks he just wants to be a hero. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> then explains that when the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> camped at Craster's <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>, he saw <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade> leave his newborn son in the woods as an offering, and the inhuman creature that took it. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> says that he wants to leave the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> because he is disgusted that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Mormont</entidade> already knew what <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade> was doing but did nothing to stop it. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> states that the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade> he is descended from defeated the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> once during The Long <entidade:Night Watch>Night</entidade>, and that now he wants "to fight for the side who fights for the living." <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance</entidade> is satisfied and advises <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> to get a new cloak.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
    <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> confronts two <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>  
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> Baratheon's forces stand victorious after the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> Lannister's new allies <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> begin to settle into the capital. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> bluntly tells his son <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that he intends to disinherit him. <entidade:This>This</entidade> comes as a shock, because his older brother <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> gave up all right to inherit his father's lands when he joined the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is rightfully the next in line of succession. <entidade:Red Fork>For</entidade> that matter, despite all evidence to the contrary, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> refuses to believe that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade>. Instead, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> obstinately maintains his belief that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is a whore-mongering, drunken, "ill-made, spiteful little creature," and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is particularly insulted that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> brought his mistress, <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, to the capital when <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> explicitly told him not to, which makes <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> convince himself that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was in bed with <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> most of the time while events spiraled out of control. When <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> asks why his father is doing this, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is shocked as if <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> insulted him, and says it should be obvious as <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> "killed" his mother <entidade:Joanna>Joanna</entidade> in childbirth so that he might enter the world. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> says that the laws of men say he has to let <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> use his family name, but that he wishes he could prove <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> wasn't his son, so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name "Lannister" which he stole from <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> fumes at the situation to his sellsword <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. He now styles himself as "Ser <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> of the Blackwater," and while possessing no lands, wealth, or title, this drastically elevates his social standing–and in his mind, his pay.
Meanwhile, Joffrey's ride back from the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Septa Unella>Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed, <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade>, stops the procession in <entidade:Flea Bottom>Flea Bottom</entidade> unexpectedly. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> shocks the guards and bewilders <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> by getting out and exploring, eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the children. Meanwhile, her servants pass out bread and toys, earning her the love of Flea Bottom's smallfolk. That evening, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> and <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> visit <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> and her brother <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> for a small dinner party. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> admonishes Margaery's boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier. 
When <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> naively defends <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> and criticizes his mother, <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> only knows how to rule through fear, but <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> knows how to win the love of the people she rules over, a skill <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> lacks. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> and <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> wants to play a game making up stories about where the ships are headed, but <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, in typical fashion, is uninterested. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> arrives to speak with <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>. 
She displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible. He suggests that when he next leaves the capital by sea, she might be able to stow away. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar. Meanwhile, <entidade:Roslin Frey>Ros</entidade>, who seems to be acting as Littlefinger's aide, reminisces about the day <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> was born, when all the bells in <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> were rung in celebration. She asks <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> to look out for <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, particularly in regards to <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>.
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> <entidade:House Baratheon Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon's shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> is rescued from the sea by <entidade:Salladhor Saan>Salladhor Saan</entidade> after being thrown overboard by the wildfire blast in the battle. <entidade:Forlorn>Forlorn</entidade> over the death of his son <entidade:Matthos Seaworth>Matthos</entidade>, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> feels that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> has led <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> to disaster, and is horrified to hear from <entidade:Salladhor Saan>Salladhor</entidade> that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices. After the defeated remnant of Stannis' forces returned to the island, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> convinces <entidade:Salladhor Saan>Salladhor</entidade> to bring him to <entidade:House Baratheon Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>. He finds <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> despondent, sitting in the <entidade:Chamber>Chamber</entidade> of the Painted Table alone with <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> openly calls <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> his enemy, condemns her for conducting human sacrifices, and says she is leading <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> astray. She counters that it was <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> who urged <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> not to bring her to the battle, and implies that it was actually Davos' fault that thousands of their men burned to death, including his own son. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the mention of his son <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> draws a knife on her in a fit of anger, but he is restrained by the guards, and <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> orders him put in the dungeon.

    <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> tries to kill <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>  
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, the morale of <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> Stark's army is starting to wane. They have not had a significant victory since the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of <entidade:Battle Oxcross>Oxcross</entidade> months ago, and the news of the Lannisters' victory over <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and new alliance with the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> piles bad news upon bad news. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> has won every battle he has ever fought, but the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head-on, so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of Robb's army. Robb's forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories, as the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> are now determined to simply wait <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> out and exhaust his army far from home while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain new allies. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> frustration, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of <entidade:Whent Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, which <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> had been using it as the main <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> forward base in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> during the first year of the war. However, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for: <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> withdrew his garrison to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> to counter the attack by <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, and didn't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> and his forces are further demoralized to find that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> massacred two hundred <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> and <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> prisoners of war before they left, and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies. They do find one survivor, a maester named <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade>.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> roasts a fish  
<entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> Targaryen's ship arrives at the city of <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade> in Slaver's Bay after leaving <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade>. Daenerys' dragons are continuing to grow, and are now about the size of small dogs. They fly about their ship as it approaches the city, plucking fish from the sea and roasting them in mid-air with their fire-breath.She notes that they are still not big enough to use as weapons of war to invade <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> with, and that she needs an army. Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> notes that the elite warrior-eunuchs produced in <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>, known as the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>, are said to be among the finest soldiers in the world. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> stresses that they are slave-soldiers, a distinction which may make some look on her negatively in <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> where slavery is illegal, but <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> says they have no better ideas for how to acquire an army. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> expresses interest in expanding her tiny <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> khalasar (most of them are seasick because the <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> have never traveled on ships before), but <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> says that other <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> will only join her if they think she is strong, and for that she needs an army.
<entidade:Upon>Upon</entidade> arriving at <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is given a tour of the Unsullied barracks by the Unsullied's owner, <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Kraznys</entidade> mo <entidade:Nakloz>Nakloz</entidade>, with his slave girl Missandei translating his <entidade:Low Valyrian>Low Valyrian</entidade> into the <entidade:Common Tongue>Common Tongue</entidade> of <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade> for <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>. They explain that the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> are trained for battle from the age of five, and that only one in four recruits survives the training. <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Kraznys</entidade> also demonstrates that the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier (much to Daenerys's disgust), who not only shows no sign of pain, but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him. <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Kraznys</entidade> goes on to explain that the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> are trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is outraged by this, but still asks how many <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> are available. She is told there are eight thousand soldiers for sale and that she has until the next day to make a decision.
<entidade:En>En</entidade> route back to their ship, Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> urges that <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> should purchase the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>, arguing that under her command, these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Kraznys</entidade> and his ilk. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is distracted by a playing child following her and <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade>, and neither notice a man in a hooded black cloak following them, armed with a dagger. 

    <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> saves <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> from a deadly manticore  
The child offers a gift to <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> - a wooden ball - but as she picks it up, the hooded stranger knocks it out of her hands; Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> grabs the stranger and their struggle knocks <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> to the ground, where to her horror, the ball cracks in half and a manticore emerges to attack. Before the creature can harm <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> with its lethal sting, the stranger impales it with his dagger and charges at the child, who hisses in a reptilian manner, baring teeth and features reminiscent of <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pyat Pree</entidade>, and uses magic to escape. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> realizes the assassin was likely an agent of the surviving Warlocks of <entidade:Warlocks Qarth>Qarth</entidade>.
Turning her attention to her savior, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is surprised when the man addresses her as his <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> and removes his hood. She asks if <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> knows the man. A stunned <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> admits he does; the stranger before them is one of the most skilled fighters in <entidade:Tongue Westeros>Westeros</entidade>: Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade>, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> Baratheon's <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>. Falling to his knees, Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> explains that following Robert's death and his dismissal by <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>, he has been searching for <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> Stormborn, to beg her forgiveness and offer his service, hoping to make amends for failing <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> Targaryen during and after Robert's Rebellion, when he served in her father's <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>. <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> hails her as the rightful <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> and asks to serve in her <entidade:Queensguard>Queensguard</entidade>.
