<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>
    <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> attacks a wight  
In a prologue scene, shouts and sword clashes are heard in the darkness as the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> and their army of undead wights attack the men of the Night's Watch off-screen in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade> of the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade>. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> is then seen alive, wandering through a blizzard in search of safety. He sees another man of the Night's Watch up ahead but soon finds that he has been decapitated and his head placed in his own hands. Just then, a wight approaches Sam and is about to attack him with an axe when the direwolf <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> knocks it down. <entidade:Ghost>Ghost</entidade> continues to tear at its legs as it pulls itself forward inch by inch towards Sam. The wight suddenly burst into flame, destroyed by a torch wielded by Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> Mormont><entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> Mormont</entidade>, killing it. Mormont has managed to rally the few dozen survivors out of his original three hundred men at the <entidade:Fist>Fist</entidade> of the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade>. Mormont is angry that Sam wasn't able to send off any messenger-ravens in the confusion of the attack. Mormont announces that they must retreat back to the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, not simply to save their own lives but because <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade> and the rest of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> must be warned of the coming threat―otherwise everyone they've ever known will die.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> is led by <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> and the Lord of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade> into the main wildling camp in the <entidade:Frostfangs>Frostfangs</entidade> mountains. It is not simply an army camp - almost all of wildling society is on the move to escape the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>, including women and children. As they enter the camp, Jon is shocked to see a real-life giant walk past. Many of the wildlings are surprised to see Jon in his all-black Night's Watch clothing and shout "Crow!" at his approach. Several young boys pelt Jon with ice and small stones, but <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> shoos them away.

    Giant carrying mammoth bones  
Jon is led into the tent of King-<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade>-the-<entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>, where the Lord of <entidade:Bones>Bones</entidade> explains that he is <entidade:<entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark><entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> Stark</entidade>'s bastard son to a large man with a heavy beard who is eating chicken by the fire. He says that he doesn't care, but his interest is piqued on hearing that Jon killed <entidade:Qhorin Halfhand>Qhorin Halfhand</entidade>. As they talk, Jon kneels before the man, whom he assumes to be <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade>, and calls him "Your <entidade:Grace>Grace</entidade>" as he would a king south of the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>. All the wildlings to burst into laughter; their society does not bother with such ceremony–and because the man actually isn't Mance, but his lieutenant <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund Giantsbane</entidade>. Mance himself is an unassuming man sitting in a corner, who then introduces himself and tells Jon to stand, as no man kneels before another among the <entidade:Free Folk>Free Folk</entidade>, as they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture.
Mance says he is glad that Jon killed Qhorin, as he had killed many of Mance's wildlings, though he notes that Qhorin was his brother once, back when he was a member of the Night's Watch and Qhorin had a whole hand. Mance asks Jon why he wants to join them. He replies that he wants to be free, but Mance thinks he just wants to be a hero. Jon then explains that when the Night's Watch camped at Craster's <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>, he saw Craster leave his newborn son in the woods as an offering, and the inhuman creature that took it. Jon says that he wants to leave the Night's Watch because he is disgusted that Mormont already knew what Craster was doing but did nothing to stop it. Jon states that the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade> he is descended from defeated the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> once during The <entidade:Long Night>Long Night</entidade>, and that now he wants "to fight for the side who fights for the living." Mance is satisfied and advises Jon to get a new cloak.

In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
    <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> confronts two <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>  
In King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, King <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade>'s forces stand victorious after the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade>'s new allies <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> begin to settle into the capital. <entidade:<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> bluntly tells his son <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> that he intends to disinherit him. <entidade:This>This</entidade> comes as a shock, because his older brother Jaime gave up all right to inherit his father's lands when he joined the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is rightfully the next in line of succession. <entidade:Red Fork>For</entidade> that matter, despite all evidence to the contrary, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> refuses to believe that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> of the King. Instead, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> obstinately maintains his belief that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is a whore-mongering, drunken, "ill-made, spiteful little creature," and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is particularly insulted that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> brought his mistress, <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, to the capital when <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> explicitly told him not to, which makes <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> convince himself that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was in bed with <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> most of the time while events spiraled out of control. When <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> asks why his father is doing this, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is shocked as if <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> insulted him, and says it should be obvious as <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> "killed" his mother <entidade:Joanna>Joanna</entidade> in childbirth so that he might enter the world. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> says that the laws of men say he has to let <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> use his family name, but that he wishes he could prove <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> wasn't his son, so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name "Lannister" which he stole from <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> fumes at the situation to his sellsword <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade>, who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. He now styles himself as "Ser <entidade:Bronn>Bronn</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>," and while possessing no lands, wealth, or title, this drastically elevates his social standing–and in his mind, his pay.
Meanwhile, Joffrey's ride back from the <entidade:<entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept><entidade:Great <entidade:High Hall>Hall</entidade>>Great</entidade> Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade> in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed, <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Margaery Tyrell>Margaery Tyrell</entidade>, stops the procession in <entidade:Flea Bottom>Flea Bottom</entidade> unexpectedly. Margaery shocks the guards and bewilders Joffrey by getting out and exploring, eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the children. Meanwhile, her servants pass out bread and toys, earning her the love of <entidade:Flea Bottom>Flea Bottom</entidade>'s smallfolk. That evening, Joffrey and Cersei visit Margaery and her brother <entidade:<entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> Tyrell><entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> Tyrell</entidade> for a small dinner party. Cersei admonishes Margaery's boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier. 
When Joffrey naively defends Margaery and criticizes his mother, Cersei realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered. Cersei only knows how to rule through fear, but Margaery knows how to win the love of the people she rules over, a skill Cersei lacks. <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> and <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart. Sansa wants to play a game making up stories about where the ships are headed, but <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>, in typical fashion, is uninterested. <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr Baelish</entidade> arrives to speak with Sansa. 
She displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible. He suggests that when he next leaves the capital by sea, she might be able to stow away. Sansa advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar. Meanwhile, Ros, who seems to be acting as <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>'s aide, reminisces about the day Sansa was born, when all the bells in <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> were rung in celebration. She asks <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> to look out for Sansa, particularly in regards to <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>.
<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, King <entidade:<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>'s shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. <entidade:<entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth><entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth</entidade> is rescued from the sea by <entidade:<entidade:Salladhor Saan>Salladhor</entidade> Saan><entidade:Salladhor Saan>Salladhor</entidade> Saan</entidade> after being thrown overboard by the wildfire blast in the battle. <entidade:Forlorn>Forlorn</entidade> over the death of his son <entidade:Matthos Seaworth>Matthos</entidade>, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> feels that <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> has led <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> to disaster, and is horrified to hear from <entidade:Salladhor Saan>Salladhor</entidade> that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices. After the defeated remnant of <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>' forces returned to the island, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the Lord of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> convinces <entidade:Salladhor Saan>Salladhor</entidade> to bring him to <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>. He finds <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> despondent, sitting in the <entidade:Chamber>Chamber</entidade> of the <entidade:Painted Table>Painted Table</entidade> alone with <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> openly calls <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> his enemy, condemns her for conducting human sacrifices, and says she is leading <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> astray. She counters that it was <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> who urged <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> not to bring her to the battle, and implies that it was actually <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade>' fault that thousands of their men burned to death, including his own son. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the mention of his son <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> draws a knife on her in a fit of anger, but he is restrained by the guards, and <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> orders him put in the dungeon.

    <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> tries to kill <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>  
In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, the morale of King <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s army is starting to wane. They have not had a significant victory since the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of <entidade:Oxcross>Oxcross</entidade> months ago, and the news of the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>' victory over <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and new alliance with the Tyrells piles bad news upon bad news. Robb has won every battle he has ever fought, but the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head-on, so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of Robb's army. Robb's forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories, as the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> are now determined to simply wait Robb out and exhaust his army far from home while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain new allies. In frustration, Robb launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of <entidade:Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, which <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> had been using it as the main Lannister forward base in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> during the first year of the war. However, Robb does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for: <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> withdrew his garrison to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> to counter the attack by <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, and didn't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle. Robb and his forces are further demoralized to find that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> massacred two hundred <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> and <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade> prisoners of war before they left, and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies. They do find one survivor, a maester named <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade>.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
    <entidade:Drogon>Drogon</entidade> roasts a fish  
Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>'s ship arrives at the city of <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade> in Slaver's Bay after leaving <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>. Daenerys' dragons are continuing to grow, and are now about the size of small dogs. They fly about their ship as it approaches the city, plucking fish from the sea and roasting them in mid-air with their fire-breath.She notes that they are still not big enough to use as weapons of war to invade <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> with, and that she needs an army. Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> notes that the elite warrior-eunuchs produced in <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>, known as the Unsullied, are said to be among the finest soldiers in the world. Daenerys stresses that they are slave-soldiers, a distinction which may make some look on her negatively in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> where slavery is illegal, but Jorah says they have no better ideas for how to acquire an army. Daenerys expresses interest in expanding her tiny Dothraki khalasar (most of them are seasick because the Dothraki have never traveled on ships before), but Jorah says that other Dothraki will only join her if they think she is strong, and for that she needs an army.
<entidade:Upon>Upon</entidade> arriving at <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>, Daenerys is given a tour of the Unsullied barracks by the Unsullied's owner, Kraznys mo <entidade:Nakloz>Nakloz</entidade>, with his slave girl <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> translating his <entidade:Low Valyrian>Low Valyrian</entidade> into the <entidade:Common <entidade:Common Tongue>Tongue</entidade>>Common <entidade:Common Tongue>Tongue</entidade></entidade> of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> for Daenerys. They explain that the Unsullied are trained for battle from the age of five, and that only one in four recruits survives the training. Kraznys also demonstrates that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier (much to Daenerys's disgust), who not only shows no sign of pain, but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him. Kraznys goes on to explain that the Unsullied are trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training. Daenerys is outraged by this, but still asks how many Unsullied are available. She is told there are eight thousand soldiers for sale and that she has until the next day to make a decision.
<entidade:En>En</entidade> route back to their ship, Ser Jorah urges that Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied, arguing that under her command, these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under Kraznys and his ilk. Daenerys is distracted by a playing child following her and Jorah, and neither notice a man in a hooded black cloak following them, armed with a dagger. 

    Barristan saves Daenerys from a deadly manticore  
The child offers a gift to Daenerys - a wooden ball - but as she picks it up, the hooded stranger knocks it out of her hands; Ser Jorah grabs the stranger and their struggle knocks Daenerys to the ground, where to her horror, the ball cracks in half and a manticore emerges to attack. Before the creature can harm Daenerys with its lethal sting, the stranger impales it with his dagger and charges at the child, who hisses in a reptilian manner, baring teeth and features reminiscent of <entidade:Pyat <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pree</entidade>>Pyat <entidade:Pyat Pree>Pree</entidade></entidade>, and uses magic to escape. Daenerys realizes the assassin was likely an agent of the surviving Warlocks of <entidade:Qarth>Qarth</entidade>.
Turning her attention to her savior, Daenerys is surprised when the man addresses her as his Queen and removes his hood. She asks if Jorah knows the man. A stunned Jorah admits he does; the stranger before them is one of the most skilled fighters in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>: Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade>, Lord <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert Baratheon</entidade>'s <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>. Falling to his knees, Ser Barristan explains that following Robert's death and his dismissal by Joffrey, he has been searching for Daenerys Stormborn, to beg her forgiveness and offer his service, hoping to make amends for failing House <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> during and after Robert's Rebellion, when he served in her father's <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>. Barristan hails her as the rightful Queen and asks to serve in her <entidade:Queensgard>Queensguard</entidade>.
