Summary
Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
Daenerys, Jorah and Barristan hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>, a professional mercenary company, the "powerful friends" the Yunkish have employed. Barristan explains that although there are only 2,000 of them, the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> are armored and mounted, enough to cause trouble for the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>. Daenerys tells Barristan to organize a meeting with the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>' captains, saying that men who fight for gold "can't afford to lose to a girl."
Shortly thereafter, Daenerys hosts the captains <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade>, a <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> also known as the Titan's Bastard, and <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade> na <entidade:Ghezn>Ghezn</entidade>, a Ghiscari. Also in attendance is <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade>'s capable and striking lieutenant, <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade>. The uncouth and sexually vulgar <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> makes himself at home, observes that Daenerys looks like a whore he knows in Lys and feels up Missandei, although the surprisingly gracious queen shrugs his insults off. <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade> and <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> refuse Daenerys' offer of an alliance, pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>, which is still a distant prospect. With aplomb she replies that a fortnight previous she had no army, and a year before that she had no dragons. Smiling gently she gives them two days to make a decision and sends them off with a barrel of wine <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> had demanded. Daario smiles over his back at her as they depart. Once the sellswords are gone, Daenerys drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade>'s back, instructs Barristan that if they must fight the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>, he is to kill <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> first. Selmy replies that he would be glad to do so.
At the mercenary camp, <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> fondles a Yunkish pleasure-slave while discussing the situation with <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade> and Daario. It swiftly becomes apparent that Daario and <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> do not agree, but <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade> cuts off their philosophical discussion to call for action over "the dragon bitch." They eventually decide to simply assassinate Daenerys and be done with it. <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> gives the slave three coins, one each from <entidade:Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, <entidade:Meereen –>Meereen</entidade>, and <entidade:Braavos>Braavos</entidade>, and tells her to randomly give them to the three mercenaries – the one who gets the <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> coin will kill the queen.

    Daario (dressed as an <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>) holds a knife at Missandei's throat.  
That night, as Daenerys bathes, she is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks no fewer than nineteen languages. Missandei says this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>. The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> enters and hold a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He explains that he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains, but they ran into a "philosophical disagreement" over her beauty. He then produces their severed heads. Intrigued, Daenerys rises from her bath and asks if Daario will swear fealty to her. He bends the knee and swears his sword, his men and his heart to Daenerys.

<entidade:King Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    Sam slays a <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker.  <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> continue on their journey to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, taking refuge in a destroyed cabin next to a heart tree. Before they enter, two crows land on a branch on the heart tree, and begin to squawk loudly.
Later at night, Sam tries to light a fire, but is frustrated in his attempts; <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> tries and does it easily. Meanwhile, Sam suggests that <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> name her son, but she does not know any boy names. Sam gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> likes the name Randyll, <entidade:Sam's>Sam's</entidade> father's first name, but Sam asks her not to give the child that name. Sam shares the truth about his father and his upbringing marked by cruelty which they both have in common.
Suddenly, they are interrupted by a thunderous squawking of the crows. Sam and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> go outside to investigate, and discover hundreds of crows filling the nearby tree and on the structure itself screeching violently. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> is then horrified to see a <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker approaching them, and knows that it is after her child. Sam tries to halt its advance, but the Walker shatters his sword with its bare hand and knocks him aside, then continues to bear down upon her. As the monster reaches out to seize the infant, Sam staggers back to his feet, pulls out his dragonglass dagger, and attacks the Walker, stabbing it in the back. The Walker howls in pain as its whole body begins to freeze from the point at which it was stabbed. It falls to its knees, and shatters, leaving nothing but white dust and the dagger. The dagger is left behind as Sam and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> race away in a panic. The crows fly out of the trees and chase them, screaming their hatred.

In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
<entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade>, now a captive of <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> after he kidnapped her from the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> Without Banners, picks up a rock and stands over him planning to strike. She thinks he is sound asleep. He opens his eyes and tells her she has one chance to hit him, and kill him, but if she fails he will break her hands. Later she sits on the horse with him sullen and refusing food he offers her. Sandor points out that for all she hates him, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> could have been taken captive by someone far worse. He tells her about Sansa and how he rescued her from a group of would-be rapists. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> disbelieves this, but Sandor says "<entidade:Ask>Ask</entidade> your sister if you ever see her again." They arrive at a river which <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> initially thinks to be the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. Rather confused with her lack of understanding he points out that the river is the <entidade:Red Fork>Red Fork</entidade> of the Trident. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> believed he was taking her back to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, but he reveals that he is in fact taking her to The <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, where her mother and brother will shortly be attending her uncle's wedding, and he will ransom her to them. He tells her ruefully that if she wasn't so busy trying to kill him they might make it in time for the wedding. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> has a small and hidden smile as the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> spurs the horse to a gallop.
<entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> finally arrives back at <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>   with <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> in tow. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> is less than impressed by the sight of the bastard boy who is technically his nephew and is bemused when <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> orders him fed, bathed and clothed. He believes it is pointless as they intend to sacrifice him, but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> reveals it is merely a sham to keep <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> feeling secure, in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade>, still languishing in his cell, is paid a visit by <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>; Davos is told of the impending sacrifice of <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>. Davos protests this saying that unlike Renly who was a rebel against his rightful king, <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> is an innocent who has never done him any wrong. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory, which <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> believes is the only way to save every man, woman and child in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path. He asks how Davos can doubt the power of <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s God  when <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> has seen visions of "a great battle in the snow" and Davos saw the creature she gave birth to. Davos speculates that the real reason <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> came is because deep down, a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong and he knew Davos would tell him the truth he needs to hear, regardless of how it would be taken. After extracting a promise from Davos that he won't act against <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> again, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> has him released.

    <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> naming the 3 usurpers.  
In <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>'s quarters, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> seduces <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> long enough to distract him, then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body. She explains as <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> and Davos enter the room that Davos wanted a demonstration of the power in king's blood, then removes the leeches and lights a fire in a nearby brazier. As part of the magical ritual that follows, <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> throws the leeches into the flames at <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s direction, and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn: "The usurper <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>, the usurper <entidade:Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>, the usurper <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade>."
At <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> speaks with Sansa before their wedding at the <entidade:Great Sept>Great Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>; though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> promises Sansa that he will not mistreat her, and Sansa agrees there are worse <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> she could be wed to. Prior to the wedding, <entidade:Margaery Tyrell>Margaery Tyrell</entidade> tries to ingratiate herself to Cersei, commenting they will technically be sisters soon; Cersei responds by telling Margaery the story behind the "<entidade:Rains of Castamere>Rains of Castamere</entidade>," relating how it refers to the destruction of House Reyne of Castamere after their failed rebellion against <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> (inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of <entidade:<entidade:Houses Reyne>Houses</entidade> Reyne><entidade:Houses Reyne>Houses</entidade> Reyne</entidade> and Tyrell and that the same fate may fall upon <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> if they plot against the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>) and concludes by threatening to have Margaery strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call Cersei sister again. The ceremony is a grim affair; Joffrey smugly escorts Sansa to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was to stand on to cloak <entidade:Sansa in Lannister>Sansa in Lannister</entidade> colors as part of the ceremony, eliciting snickers from the congregation (though the scowl of <entidade:Lord <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>>Lord <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade></entidade> quickly silences them). <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> in the face of humiliation asks Sansa to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders. The new <entidade:High Septon>High Septon</entidade> begins the ceremony. Later as man and wife they have their reception dinner, which also proves a grim and miserable affair.

    Tyrions threatens Joffrey.  
<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> spends the wedding feast mostly by getting deeply drunk and making light of his father's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, drunkenly proclaiming himself "the god of tits and wine," reminds his father that <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> has long called him "a drunken little lust-filled beast," so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem. At the same time, Joffrey is himself drinking too much wine, and losing what few inhibitions he has, his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both Sansa and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>. <entidade:Against Cersei>Against Cersei</entidade>'s ineffectual protests, Joffrey gets up and, flanked by his <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, taunts Sansa that she's still found a way to marry a Lannister. Joffrey then ponders that it doesn't matter which Lannister gets her pregnant, and openly says he might want to rape her after <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is done with her, while the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> hold her down.
Joffrey then declares it time for the bedding ceremony (which involves the men at the wedding stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed) but <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> angrily insists there will be no bedding ceremony. When Joffrey keeps pushing the matter, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> slams his dagger into the table and threatens that Joffrey will "be fucking [his] own bride with a wooden cock" if he doesn't let it drop. As the court stands in shocked silence, Joffrey seethes with outrage and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred. After a tense moment, <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony, and placates Joffrey by claiming <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk. Taking the hint, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is, intentionally humiliating himself, and says he only made a bad joke. It isn't clear if anyone in the room, including <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> or Joffrey, think that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s outburst was simply due to being very drunk, but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand, escorts Sansa to their bedchamber.
Once they are alone in their quarters, a tense moment passes as Sansa nervously and slowly undresses. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> ultimately tells her to stop, deciding that he will not consummate the marriage if she does not want to, and only will if she changes her mind. When Sansa questions what he will do if she never does, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically jokes "And so my watch begins" - implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> - and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch. The following morning, <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> notices with a hint of a smile that Sansa's bed sheets are not stained with blood and <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s virgin bride is still a virgin.
