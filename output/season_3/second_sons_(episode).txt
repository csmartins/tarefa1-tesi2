Summary
Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
Daenerys, <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>, a professional mercenary company, the "powerful friends" the <entidade:Yunkish>Yunkish</entidade> have employed. <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> explains that although there are only 2,000 of them, the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade> are armored and mounted, enough to cause trouble for the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> tells <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> to organize a meeting with the Second Sons' captains, saying that men who fight for gold "can't afford to lose to a girl."
Shortly thereafter, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> hosts the captains <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade>, a <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> also known as the Titan's Bastard, and <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade> na <entidade:Ghezn>Ghezn</entidade>, a <entidade:Old Ghiscari>Ghiscari</entidade>. Also in attendance is Prendahl's capable and striking lieutenant, <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade>. The uncouth and sexually vulgar <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> makes himself at home, observes that <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> looks like a whore he knows in <entidade:Lysa Tully>Lys</entidade> and feels up <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade>, although the surprisingly gracious queen shrugs his insults off. <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade> and <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> refuse Daenerys' offer of an alliance, pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>, which is still a distant prospect. With aplomb she replies that a fortnight previous she had no army, and a year before that she had no dragons. Smiling gently she gives them two days to make a decision and sends them off with a barrel of wine Mero had demanded. <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> smiles over his back at her as they depart. Once the sellswords are gone, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at Mero's back, instructs <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> that if they must fight the <entidade:Second Sons>Second Sons</entidade>, he is to kill <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> first. Selmy replies that he would be glad to do so.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the mercenary camp, <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> fondles a <entidade:Yunkish>Yunkish</entidade> pleasure-slave while discussing the situation with <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade> and <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade>. It swiftly becomes apparent that <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> and <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> do not agree, but <entidade:Prendahl>Prendahl</entidade> cuts off their philosophical discussion to call for action over "the dragon bitch." They eventually decide to simply assassinate <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> and be done with it. <entidade:Mero>Mero</entidade> gives the slave three coins, one each from <entidade:Talisa of Volantis>Volantis</entidade>, <entidade:Meereenese Knot>Meereen</entidade>, and <entidade:Braavosi>Braavos</entidade>, and tells her to randomly give them to the three mercenaries – the one who gets the <entidade:Braavosi>Braavosi</entidade> coin will kill the queen.

    <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> (dressed as an Unsullied) holds a knife at Missandei's throat.  
That night, as <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> bathes, she is surprised to learn that <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> speaks no fewer than nineteen languages. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> says this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> a year to gain a reasonable grasp of <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade>. The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable <entidade:Dothraki Sea>Dothraki</entidade> and switches to the language to teach <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> enters and hold a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade>. He explains that he is here to kill <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> on orders from his captains, but they ran into a "philosophical disagreement" over her beauty. He then produces their severed heads. <entidade:Intrigued>Intrigued</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> rises from her bath and asks if <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario</entidade> will swear fealty to her. He bends the knee and swears his sword, his men and his heart to <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>.

<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> slays a <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade>.  <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> continue on their journey to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, taking refuge in a destroyed cabin next to a heart tree. Before they enter, two crows land on a branch on the heart tree, and begin to squawk loudly.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> at night, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> tries to light a fire, but is frustrated in his attempts; <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> tries and does it easily. Meanwhile, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> suggests that <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> name her son, but she does not know any boy names. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> likes the name <entidade:Randyll Tarly>Randyll</entidade>, Sam's father's first name, but <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> asks her not to give the child that name. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> shares the truth about his father and his upbringing marked by cruelty which they both have in common.
Suddenly, they are interrupted by a thunderous squawking of the crows. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> go outside to investigate, and discover hundreds of crows filling the nearby tree and on the structure itself screeching violently. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> is then horrified to see a <entidade:White Walkers>White</entidade> <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade> approaching them, and knows that it is after her child. <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> tries to halt its advance, but the <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade> shatters his sword with its bare hand and knocks him aside, then continues to bear down upon her. As the monster reaches out to seize the infant, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> staggers back to his feet, pulls out his dragonglass dagger, and attacks the <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade>, stabbing it in the back. The <entidade:White Walkers>Walker</entidade> howls in pain as its whole body begins to freeze from the point at which it was stabbed. It falls to its knees, and shatters, leaving nothing but white dust and the dagger. The dagger is left behind as <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Sam</entidade> and Gilly race away in a panic. The crows fly out of the trees and chase them, screaming their hatred.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, now a captive of <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> Clegane after he kidnapped her from the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> Without Banners, picks up a rock and stands over him planning to strike. She thinks he is sound asleep. He opens his eyes and tells her she has one chance to hit him, and kill him, but if she fails he will break her hands. Later she sits on the horse with him sullen and refusing food he offers her. Sandor points out that for all she hates him, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> could have been taken captive by someone far worse. He tells her about <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and how he rescued her from a group of would-be rapists. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> disbelieves this, but <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> says "Ask your sister if you ever see her again." They arrive at a river which Arya initially thinks to be the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>. Rather confused with her lack of understanding he points out that the river is the Red Fork of the <entidade:River Trident>Trident</entidade>. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> believed he was taking her back to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, but he reveals that he is in fact taking her to The <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, where her mother and brother will shortly be attending her uncle's wedding, and he will ransom her to them. He tells her ruefully that if she wasn't so busy trying to kill him they might make it in time for the wedding. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> has a small and hidden smile as the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> spurs the horse to a gallop.
<entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> finally arrives back at <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>   with <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> in tow. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is less than impressed by the sight of the bastard boy who is technically his nephew and is bemused when <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> orders him fed, bathed and clothed. He believes it is pointless as they intend to sacrifice him, but <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> reveals it is merely a sham to keep <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> feeling secure, in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth, still languishing in his cell, is paid a visit by Stannis; Davos is told of the impending sacrifice of <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> protests this saying that unlike Renly who was a rebel against his rightful king, <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> is an innocent who has never done him any wrong. Stannis argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory, which <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> believes is the only way to save every man, woman and child in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path. He asks how <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> can doubt the power of Melisandre's God  when <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> has seen visions of "a great battle in the snow" and <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> saw the creature she gave birth to. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> speculates that the real reason <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> came is because deep down, a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong and he knew <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> would tell him the truth he needs to hear, regardless of how it would be taken. After extracting a promise from <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> that he won't act against <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> again, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> has him released.

    <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> naming the 3 usurpers.  
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> Gendry's quarters, <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> seduces <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> long enough to distract him, then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body. She explains as <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> enter the room that <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> wanted a demonstration of the power in king's blood, then removes the leeches and lights a fire in a nearby brazier. As part of the magical ritual that follows, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> throws the leeches into the flames at Melisandre's direction, and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn: "The usurper <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, the usurper <entidade:Balon King>Balon</entidade> <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>, the usurper <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey Baratheon</entidade>."
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> speaks with <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> before their wedding at the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Septa Unella>Sept</entidade> of Baelor; though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> promises <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> that he will not mistreat her, and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> agrees there are worse <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> she could be wed to. Prior to the wedding, Margaery Tyrell tries to ingratiate herself to <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>, commenting they will technically be sisters soon; <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> responds by telling <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> the story behind the "Rains of Castamere," relating how it refers to the destruction of <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> Reyne of Castamere after their failed rebellion against <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade> (inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of Houses Reyne and <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> and that the same fate may fall upon <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> if they plot against the Lannisters) and concludes by threatening to have <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> sister again. The ceremony is a grim affair; <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> smugly escorts <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was to stand on to cloak <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> in <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> colors as part of the ceremony, eliciting snickers from the congregation (though the scowl of <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> Tywin quickly silences them). Tyrion in the face of humiliation asks <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders. The new High Septon begins the ceremony. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> as man and wife they have their reception dinner, which also proves a grim and miserable affair.

    Tyrions threatens <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>.  
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> spends the wedding feast mostly by getting deeply drunk and making light of his father's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, drunkenly proclaiming himself "the god of tits and wine," reminds his father that <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> has long called him "a drunken little lust-filled beast," so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the same time, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is himself drinking too much wine, and losing what few inhibitions he has, his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>. Against Cersei's ineffectual protests, <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> gets up and, flanked by his <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade>, taunts <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> that she's still found a way to marry a <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade>. <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> then ponders that it doesn't matter which <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> gets her pregnant, and openly says he might want to rape her after <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is done with her, while the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> hold her down.
<entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> then declares it time for the bedding ceremony (which involves the men at the wedding stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed) but <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> angrily insists there will be no bedding ceremony. When <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> keeps pushing the matter, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> slams his dagger into the table and threatens that <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> will "be fucking [his] own bride with a wooden cock" if he doesn't let it drop. As the court stands in shocked silence, Joffrey seethes with outrage and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred. After a tense moment, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony, and placates <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> by claiming Tyrion's outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk. Taking the hint, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is, intentionally humiliating himself, and says he only made a bad joke. It isn't clear if anyone in the room, including <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> or <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade>, think that Tyrion's outburst was simply due to being very drunk, but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand, escorts <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> to their bedchamber.
Once they are alone in their quarters, a tense moment passes as <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> nervously and slowly undresses. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> ultimately tells her to stop, deciding that he will not consummate the marriage if she does not want to, and only will if she changes her mind. When <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> questions what he will do if she never does, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> sarcastically jokes "And so my watch begins" - implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> - and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch. The following morning, <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> notices with a hint of a smile that Sansa's bed sheets are not stained with blood and Tyrion's virgin bride is still a virgin.
