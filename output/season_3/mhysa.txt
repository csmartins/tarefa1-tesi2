Plot
Joffrey challenges <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> tells a ghost story. In <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>, mercy comes from strange quarters. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> waits to see if she is a conqueror or a liberator.

Summary
In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
At the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, the carnage at the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade> continues to unfold. While the Northern lords are being slaughtered in the main hall, outside the walls of the castle <entidade:House Frey>House Frey</entidade> soldiers ambush the Stark army in its own camp. What follows is not a battle but a one-sided massacre as the Northern army is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies. The betrayers torch all of the camp's tents, with many men burning alive inside of them. Frey men wildly mutilate the dead and dying. From one of the twin towers of the Frey stronghold, Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> watches the massacre.

    Robb's corpse desecrated, with his direwolf's head sewn in place of his own.  
<entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> attempts to slip away amidst the carnage on a horse, along with the unconscious <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade>, by casually riding away while carrying a Frey banner. Before they can leave, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> regains consciousness - as she and the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> turn to see a group of Frey men shouting as they march through the main gate. The <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> have horrifically desecrated <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s corpse by decapitating it, then crudely attaching the severed head of his direwolf <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade> in its place. <entidade:Drunk>Drunk</entidade> with "victory", the <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> gleefully parade the mutilated body around the castle on a horse while mockingly chanting "King in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>! King in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>! Here he comes, the King in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>!", which is met with by cheers and peals of laughter from the crowds of Frey soldiers.
Sandor is horrified by the gruesome spectacle, while he holds <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade>, who looks on with a dead stare. The <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> rides away with her, undisturbed thanks to the Frey banner in his hand.
In the great hall of the castle the following morning, as servants clean up the pools of blood left by their former wedding guests, Lords <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade> and Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them. Frey will become <entidade:Lord of <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>>Lord of <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade></entidade>, and the <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> will replace the <entidade:Tullys>Tullys</entidade> as the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>' vassals in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> has been appointed as the new <entidade:Warden>Warden</entidade> of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, replacing the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> - though <entidade:<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> intends to eventually give the position to a future Lannister heir produced by <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>.
<entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> expresses his concern that <entidade:Brynden Tully>Brynden</entidade> <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade> escaped the massacre, but Walder dismisses his worries, pointing out that the <entidade:Blackfish>Blackfish</entidade> - and the remaining <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade> garrison at <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>, and <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade>, although <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> is still visibly concerned. <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> makes plain his contempt for <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>, considering the late boy-king arrogant, politically incompetent, and unwilling to take Roose's advice and make the hard decisions needed to win. Walder questions Roose if he intends to rule the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> from <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>, and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time, after it is rebuilt. This leads Walder to ask how <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> ended up a ruin. Roose explains that his bastard son <entidade:Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> offered <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>, but when they did they learned that Ramsay, in his father's words, "has his own way of doing things"...
At the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>, <entidade:Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> eats his breakfast of a thick sausage, taunting Theon about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and blood-stained trousers, and laughing as Theon finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare. Ramsay tells him that he is more valuable alive than dead so the answer must be no. Ramsay notes that Theon reeks, and decides that that shall be his new name: <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>. Theon refuses to acknowledge the name, twice insisting that he is <entidade:Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Theon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade>, but after Ramsay beats him, he finally breaks down and says his name is <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>.
​On <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>, <entidade:Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Balon <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> reads a message from <entidade:Lord <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>'s>Lord <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>'s</entidade> bastard while his daughter <entidade:<entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>><entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> kraken. As Ramsay's letter explains the box contains "<entidade:Theon's>Theon's</entidade> favorite toy." The message bluntly says that the ironborn have until the full moon to withdraw from the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> or receive more bits and pieces of Theon. In addition any remaining ironborn will be flayed alive - just as Ramsay flayed alive <entidade:Theon's>Theon's</entidade> twenty ironborn followers at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> after they surrendered, even though he had promised them safe passage. It was in fact <entidade:Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Ramsay <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> and his soldiers from House <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade> who burned <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> to the ground: he simply sent false reports for his father Roose to deliver to <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade> which claimed that the ironborn were responsible, as the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> were preparing to betray the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> months before the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade>.
Balon acts indifferent to <entidade:Theon's>Theon's</entidade> situation since he defied Balon's orders and <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade>'s common sense when he stayed at <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>. Furthermore, he cannot further the <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> line as the contents of the box prove. However, <entidade:Yara <entidade:House Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade>>Yara</entidade> does not share her father's attitude toward her last living brother. She announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best men, sail around <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, besiege the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>, and liberate Theon.
In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, a despondent <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> and <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> ride away from the outskirts of the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>. They pass close to a small group of Frey men, one of whom is bragging about being one of the men who cut off <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade>'s head and attached it to <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s body. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the fire. She offers the coin given to her by <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar><entidade:Jaqen H'ghar>Jaqen</entidade> H'ghar</entidade> as payment. When the Frey man investigates, she stabs him in the neck. Slightly thrown, the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade> deals with the others before demanding to know where <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> got the knife. She reveals it's his. He admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that. As he grumbles and cleans up the bodies, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> whispers, "valar morghulis".
Meanwhile, in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> walk through the gardens. A pair of passing gentlemen snigger at <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage. Sansa tells him to pay them no mind. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> reminds Sansa that he's used to it, as he's always been a dwarf. He also states that he's not Joffrey, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> would rather bide his time and humiliate them. Sansa playfully follows his line of thinking, and suggests "sheep-shifting"- secretly hiding sheep's dung deep within a mattress (as <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> used to do to her), so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is amused but is confused by the term, though he realizes belatedly that Sansa has misheard the word "shit". He is rescued from having to explain his wife's mistake by <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade>, who calls him to a meeting of the Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade>.
In <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>'s chambers Grand Maester <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> dithers over giving <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> a coded message from <entidade:Lord Frey>Lord Frey</entidade>. Joffrey jubilantly explains its meaning that Robb and <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> are both dead. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is visibly startled by the news, already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause, but Joffrey brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve Robb's severed head to Sansa at his wedding feast. None of the Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade> are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> points out that Sansa is Joffrey's aunt by marriage now (and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords).
A deeply embarrassed Cersei forces a smile and insists to the rest of the council that Joffrey was only joking and did not mean it. This puzzles Joffrey, who matter-of-factly states to his mother that he did mean it, and he will have Robb's head served at his wedding feast. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> flatly forbids it and tells <entidade:Joffrey that Sansa>Joffrey that Sansa</entidade> isn't his to torment anymore. Joffrey angrily proclaims that he is the king, and everyone is his to torment. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> counters that a king who has to remind his subjects that he is the king, is no king. Joffrey goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather, deriding <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> as a coward who hid under <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade> while Joffrey's father <entidade:King Robert>King Robert</entidade> won the real war when he overthrew the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade>. The entire Small <entidade:Council –>Council</entidade> tenses waiting for <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> to respond to this shocking insult: instead <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the <entidade:Queen <entidade:Queen Regent>Regent</entidade>>Queen <entidade:Queen Regent>Regent</entidade></entidade> to see him to bed. Joffrey weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his mother, and <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> also asks <entidade:Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep.
<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> dismisses the rest of the council, save <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, who drily notes that the Lord of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> has been sent to bed without his supper. He confronts <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> about his part in the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade>, and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it, as <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade> is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own. The <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> blithely confirms this. He dismisses <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s concerns that the <entidade:Northerners>Northerners</entidade> will never forget nor forgive such an outrage, arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> shows his distaste for <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade>'s choice of a wedding as the place to inflict the slaughter, but <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> responds, asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in battle is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a wedding.
<entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> again waxes poetic about family, noting <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>'s failure to consummate his marriage to Sansa. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> refuses to force himself on Sansa to do his duty, and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> have murdered her mother and brother. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> demands to know when <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> ever put the family's interests above his own. <entidade:Lord Tywin>Tywin</entidade> retorts that he did exactly that on the day that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> was born: he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea, but instead he spared him and raised him as his son, because he is a Lannister.
Immediately after leaving, <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> returns to his chambers and calls for Sansa, who simply regards him with a forlorn, tear-streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family's death. <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> backs out, knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort.
Elsewhere in the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> meets with <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>. He tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> - and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade> to build a new, lavish life for herself. <entidade:Lord Varys>Varys</entidade> is convinced that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> is the last hope for the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>' current regime, therefore <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> is a weakness that <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade>, and thus the realm, cannot afford. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> confirms that she is in love with <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> and that she cares deeply for Sansa as well, but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses, <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> will not leave until or unless <entidade:Quickly Tyrion>Tyrion</entidade> asks her to.
Unknown to everyone in <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade>, and <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> finally arrive; the city folk do not even recognize Jaime after his long absence from the capital. They make their way to the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade>, where Jaime immediately calls on Cersei, who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing hand.
At <entidade:Dragonstone Isle>Dragonstone</entidade>, Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> tests his new-found literacy on <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon's correspondence, declining <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen Baratheon</entidade>'s invitation to read more tales of <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> I Targaryen. He expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word "night", before hearing the horns that signal <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s intents to sacrifice <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>. He argues with <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> again about sacrificing the boy, but <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> is convinced by <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> that using <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the <entidade:Iron Fleet>Iron</entidade> <entidade:Throne Room>Throne</entidade>. When he doesn't get through to his liege, Davos takes matters into his own hands and frees the boy, giving him a rowboat and directions to <entidade:King's Landing>King's Landing</entidade>. A furious <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> sentences Davos to death but the <entidade:Onion Knight>Onion Knight</entidade> produces a letter from the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. Davos insists that it is <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade>' duty to assist the black brothers, and that he will need Davos's assistance to rally troops and mercenaries. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> burns the letter and acknowledges the truth: the <entidade:War>War</entidade> of the <entidade:Five Kings>Five Kings</entidade> is irrelevant. The true war lies in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, and evil and death are marching on the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. She also agrees that Davos has an important role to play in the events to come. <entidade:Lord Stannis>Stannis</entidade> sarcastically laughs at <entidade:R'hllor>R'hllor</entidade>'s sense of humor, noting that the god Davos likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose.

At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
Arriving at the abandoned <entidade:Nightfort>Nightfort</entidade>, Meera <entidade:House Reed>Reed</entidade> tells <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>, Hodor and <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> that the castle is safe to enter. While around the fire <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> tells the story of the <entidade:Rat Cook>Rat Cook</entidade>, a <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> member who killed a guest under his roof, a sin the gods cannot forgive. Later that night, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> is awoken by a sound, and wakes his companions in time to see something large climbing out of the castle well; Meera attacks and overpowers the intruder, who is revealed to be <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade>, accompanied by <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade>. Sam quickly deduces <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s identity by recognizing <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s direwolf and Hodor. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> asks Sam to take him and his group north of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, and though Sam protests the idea, given the threat of the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers and the undead horde they command approaching, he eventually relents and takes them through the passage. Before they separate Sam gives the group the rest of his dragonglass supply and tells them that it has the power to kill <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers. The groups then head in different directions; Sam and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> for <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, and the <entidade:Reeds>Reeds</entidade>, Hodor, and <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> beyond the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>.
At <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, Sam and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> meet with <entidade:Maester Aemon>Maester Aemon</entidade>, who is furious at the prospect of Sam having violated his vows. Sam defends himself by reciting the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> they are on and repeating Jeor <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade>'s assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians. Aemon's demeanor softens upon learning that <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> was one of <entidade:Crasters Keep>Craster</entidade>'s wives, and acknowledges that she is now a refugee and should be sheltered. Aemon then orders Sam to begin writing letters immediately and make sure that all forty-four of <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>'s ravens are well-fed, as every one of them is to fly that night: the <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walkers have returned, and <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> must be warned.
Stopping to rest and tend to his injuries after fleeing the wildlings, <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> finds himself confronted by a furious <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>, who has an arrow ready to shoot him. Jon tries to talk <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> out of shooting him, insisting that he still loves her but that she should have known his loyalty to the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> was never gone. Though his feelings are clearly reciprocated, <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> is still angered by his betrayal and shoots Jon three times with her bow as he flees from her, watching him go with tears in her eyes.
Jon is badly injured, but his horse manages to carry him the rest of the way to <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, as he hovers in and out of consciousness. Having reached safety, Jon is brought inside the castle by the guards, where he encounters Sam and <entidade:Pypar>Pypar</entidade>, who are overjoyed to see him and insist that his injuries be taken care of.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
<entidade:Outside>Outside</entidade> the walls of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> and her advisors wait for the city's slaves to appear. Daenerys frets that the Yunkish slaves, who are better treated than <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>'s might have grown to like their chains and will not welcome freedom. Finally, the gates open and the freedmen pour out. Missandei begins to tell them of how Daenerys the <entidade:Unburnt>Unburnt</entidade> freed them, but Daenerys interrupts and says that it is the slaves' own choice to reach for their freedom. After a moment, one of the freedmen stretches his hand towards Daenerys and calls out "mhysa". After a moment, another follows suit, then another and another until the entire crowd is chanting "mhysa". <entidade:Bewildered>Bewildered</entidade>, Daenerys turns to Missandei, who reveals that the word means "mother" in the <entidade:Old Ghiscari>Old Ghiscari</entidade> language. When the slaves advance on Daenerys, the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> step into formation, but the queen tells them to stand down. Telling her dragons to fly, Daenerys steps out of the protection of the <entidade:Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> and into the crowd, who carry on their chanting. Daenerys is embraced by the former slaves, offering a glimmer of hope in an increasingly darker and hopeless world.
