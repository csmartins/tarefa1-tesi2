Plot
Joffrey challenges <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> tells a ghost story. In <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, mercy comes from strange quarters. <entidade:Dany>Dany</entidade> waits to see if she is a conqueror or a liberator.

<entidade:Summary>Summary</entidade>
In the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, the carnage at the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade> continues to unfold. While the <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> lords are being slaughtered in the main hall, outside the walls of the castle <entidade:House Frey>House Frey</entidade> soldiers ambush the Stark army in its own camp. What follows is not a battle but a one-sided massacre as the <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> army is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies. The betrayers torch all of the camp's tents, with many men burning alive inside of them. Frey men wildly mutilate the dead and dying. From one of the twin towers of the Frey stronghold, <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> watches the massacre.

    Robb's corpse desecrated, with his direwolf's head sewn in place of his own.  
<entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> attempts to slip away amidst the carnage on a horse, along with the unconscious <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade>, by casually riding away while carrying a Frey banner. Before they can leave, Arya regains consciousness - as she and the Hound turn to see a group of Frey men shouting as they march through the main gate. The <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> have horrifically desecrated <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s corpse by decapitating it, then crudely attaching the severed head of his direwolf <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade> in its place. Drunk with "victory", the <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> gleefully parade the mutilated body around the castle on a horse while mockingly chanting "King in the North! King in the North! Here he comes, the King in the North!", which is met with by cheers and peals of laughter from the crowds of Frey soldiers.
Sandor is horrified by the gruesome spectacle, while he holds Arya, who looks on with a dead stare. The Hound rides away with her, undisturbed thanks to the Frey banner in his hand.
In the great hall of the castle the following morning, as servants clean up the pools of blood left by their former wedding guests, Lords <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade> and <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them. Frey will become Lord of <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>, and the <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade> will replace the <entidade:Tullys>Tullys</entidade> as the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>' vassals in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> has been appointed as the new <entidade:War>Warden</entidade> of the North, replacing the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> - though <entidade:<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> Lannister</entidade> intends to eventually give the position to a future Lannister heir produced by <entidade:<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade>.
<entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> expresses his concern that <entidade:Brynden Tully>Brynden Tully</entidade> escaped the massacre, but Walder dismisses his worries, pointing out that the <entidade:Blackfish>Blackfish</entidade> - and the remaining Tully garrison at <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>, <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade>, and <entidade:Freys>Freys</entidade>, although <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> is still visibly concerned. <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> makes plain his contempt for <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>, considering the late boy-king arrogant, politically incompetent, and unwilling to take <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade>'s advice and make the hard decisions needed to win. Walder questions <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> if he intends to rule the North from <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>, and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time, after it is rebuilt. <entidade:This>This</entidade> leads Walder to ask how <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> ended up a ruin. <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> explains that his bastard son <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay Snow</entidade> offered <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over Theon Greyjoy, but when they did they learned that Ramsay, in his father's words, "has his own way of doing things"...
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>, <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay Snow</entidade> eats his breakfast of a thick sausage, taunting Theon about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and blood-stained trousers, and laughing as Theon finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare. Ramsay tells him that he is more valuable alive than dead so the answer must be no. Ramsay notes that Theon reeks, and decides that that shall be his new name: <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>. Theon refuses to acknowledge the name, twice insisting that he is Theon Greyjoy, but after Ramsay beats him, he finally breaks down and says his name is <entidade:Reek>Reek</entidade>.
​<entidade:Onion Knight>On</entidade> <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:on Greyjoy>Balon Greyjoy</entidade>><entidade:on Greyjoy>Balon Greyjoy</entidade></entidade> reads a message from Lord <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>'s bastard while his daughter <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Yara Greyjoy</entidade> cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the Greyjoy kraken. As Ramsay's letter explains the box contains "Theon's favorite toy." The message bluntly says that the ironborn have until the full moon to withdraw from the North or receive more bits and pieces of Theon. In addition any remaining ironborn will be flayed alive - just as Ramsay flayed alive Theon's twenty ironborn followers at <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> after they surrendered, even though he had promised them safe passage. It was in fact <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Ramsay Snow</entidade> and his soldiers from <entidade:House <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>>House <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade></entidade> who burned <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade> to the ground: he simply sent false reports for his father <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> to deliver to <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade> which claimed that the ironborn were responsible, as the <entidade:Boltons>Boltons</entidade> were preparing to betray the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> months before the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade>.
Balon acts indifferent to Theon's situation since he defied Balon's orders and Yara's common sense when he stayed at <entidade:<entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade></entidade>. <entidade:Furthermore>Furthermore</entidade>, he cannot further the Greyjoy line as the contents of the box prove. However, Yara does not share her father's attitude toward her last living brother. She announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best men, sail around <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>, besiege the <entidade:Dreadfort>Dreadfort</entidade>, and liberate Theon.
In the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, a despondent <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya Stark</entidade> and <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> ride away from the outskirts of the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>. They pass close to a small group of Frey men, one of whom is bragging about being one of the men who cut off <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade>'s head and attached it to <entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s body. Arya approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the fire. She offers the coin given to her by <entidade:<entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H><entidade:Jaqen H>Jaqen</entidade> H</entidade>'ghar as payment. When the Frey man investigates, she stabs him in the neck. Slightly thrown, the Hound deals with the others before demanding to know where Arya got the knife. She reveals it's his. He admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that. As he grumbles and cleans up the bodies, Arya whispers, "valar morghulis".
Meanwhile, in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister><entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Sansa Stark>Sansa Stark</entidade> walk through the gardens. A pair of passing gentlemen snigger at <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage. Sansa tells him to pay them no mind. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> reminds Sansa that he's used to it, as he's always been a dwarf. He also states that he's not Joffrey, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> would rather bide his time and humiliate them. Sansa playfully follows his line of thinking, and suggests "sheep-shifting"- secretly hiding sheep's dung deep within a mattress (as Arya used to do to her), so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is amused but is confused by the term, though he realizes belatedly that Sansa has misheard the word "shit". He is rescued from having to explain his wife's mistake by <entidade:Podrick Payne>Podrick Payne</entidade>, who calls him to a meeting of the <entidade:Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade>>Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade></entidade>.
In <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>'s chambers Grand <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> dithers over giving <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> a coded message from Lord Frey. Joffrey jubilantly explains its meaning that Robb and <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn Stark</entidade> are both dead. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is visibly startled by the news, already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause, but Joffrey brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve Robb's severed head to Sansa at his wedding feast. None of the <entidade:Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade>>Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade></entidade> are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> points out that Sansa is Joffrey's aunt by marriage now (and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords).
A deeply embarrassed Cersei forces a smile and insists to the rest of the council that Joffrey was only joking and did not mean it. <entidade:This>This</entidade> puzzles Joffrey, who matter-of-factly states to his mother that he did mean it, and he will have Robb's head served at his wedding feast. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> flatly forbids it and tells Joffrey that Sansa isn't his to torment anymore. Joffrey angrily proclaims that he is the king, and everyone is his to torment. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> counters that a king who has to remind his subjects that he is the king, is no king. Joffrey goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather, deriding <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> as a coward who hid under <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade> while Joffrey's father King Robert won the real war when he overthrew the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade>. The entire <entidade:Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade>>Small <entidade:Small Council>Council</entidade></entidade> tenses waiting for <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> to respond to this shocking insult: instead <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the Queen <entidade:Regent>Regent</entidade> to see him to bed. Joffrey weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his mother, and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> also asks <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade> to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep.
<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> dismisses the rest of the council, save <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, who drily notes that the Lord of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> has been sent to bed without his supper. He confronts <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> about his part in the <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade>, and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it, as <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade> is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own. The <entidade:Bloody Hand>Hand</entidade> blithely confirms this. He dismisses <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s concerns that the <entidade:Northeners>Northerners</entidade> will never forget nor forgive such an outrage, arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> shows his distaste for <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>'s choice of a wedding as the place to inflict the slaughter, but <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> responds, asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in battle is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a wedding.
<entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> again waxes poetic about family, noting <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>'s failure to consummate his marriage to Sansa. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> refuses to force himself on Sansa to do his duty, and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> have murdered her mother and brother. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> demands to know when <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> ever put the family's interests above his own. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> retorts that he did exactly that on the day that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was born: he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea, but instead he spared him and raised him as his son, because he is a Lannister.
Immediately after leaving, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> returns to his chambers and calls for Sansa, who simply regards him with a forlorn, tear-streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family's death. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> backs out, knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort.
Elsewhere in the <entidade:Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>>Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade></entidade>, <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> meets with <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade>. He tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> - and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for <entidade:Essos>Essos</entidade> to build a new, lavish life for herself. <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> is convinced that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is the last hope for the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>' current regime, therefore <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> is a weakness that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade>, and thus the realm, cannot afford. <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> confirms that she is in love with <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> and that she cares deeply for Sansa as well, but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses, <entidade:Shae>Shae</entidade> will not leave until or unless <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> asks her to.
<entidade:Unknown>Unknown</entidade> to everyone in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime Lannister</entidade>, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of Tarth, and <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> finally arrive; the city folk do not even recognize Jaime after his long absence from the capital. They make their way to the <entidade:Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade>>Red <entidade:Red Keep>Keep</entidade></entidade>, where Jaime immediately calls on Cersei, who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing hand.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, Ser <entidade:<entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth><entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> Seaworth</entidade> tests his new-found literacy on <entidade:<entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon><entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> Baratheon</entidade>'s correspondence, declining <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen Baratheon</entidade>'s invitation to read more tales of <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> I <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>. He expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word "night", before hearing the horns that signal <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade>'s intents to sacrifice <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>. He argues with <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> again about sacrificing the boy, but <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is convinced by <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> that using <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the <entidade:Iron Throne>Iron Throne</entidade>. When he doesn't get through to his liege, <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> takes matters into his own hands and frees the boy, giving him a rowboat and directions to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. A furious <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> sentences <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> to death but the <entidade:Onion Knight>Onion Knight</entidade> produces a letter from the Night's Watch. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> insists that it is <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>' duty to assist the black brothers, and that he will need <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade>'s assistance to rally troops and mercenaries. <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> burns the letter and acknowledges the truth: the <entidade:War>War</entidade> of the Five Kings is irrelevant. The true war lies in the North, and evil and death are marching on the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>. She also agrees that <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> has an important role to play in the events to come. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> sarcastically laughs at R'hllor's sense of humor, noting that the god <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>
Arriving at the abandoned <entidade:Nightfort>Nightfort</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> Reed><entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> Reed</entidade> tells <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>, <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade> and Jojen that the castle is safe to enter. While around the fire <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> tells the story of the <entidade:Rat Cook>Rat Cook</entidade>, a Night's Watch member who killed a guest under his roof, a sin the gods cannot forgive. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> is awoken by a sound, and wakes his companions in time to see something large climbing out of the castle well; <entidade:Meera Reed>Meera</entidade> attacks and overpowers the intruder, who is revealed to be <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade>, accompanied by <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade>. Sam quickly deduces <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s identity by recognizing <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s direwolf and <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> asks Sam to take him and his group north of the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>, and though Sam protests the idea, given the threat of the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> and the undead horde they command approaching, he eventually relents and takes them through the passage. Before they separate Sam gives the group the rest of his dragonglass supply and tells them that it has the power to kill <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade>. The groups then head in different directions; Sam and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> for <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>, and the <entidade:Reeds>Reeds</entidade>, <entidade:Hodor>Hodor</entidade>, and <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> beyond the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade>.
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>, Sam and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> meet with <entidade:Maester>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade>, who is furious at the prospect of Sam having violated his vows. Sam defends himself by reciting the Night's Watch oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the <entidade:Tall>Wall</entidade> they are on and repeating <entidade:<entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> Mormont><entidade:Jeor Mormont>Jeor</entidade> Mormont</entidade>'s assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade>'s demeanor softens upon learning that <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> was one of Craster's wives, and acknowledges that she is now a refugee and should be sheltered. <entidade:Aemon Targaryen>Aemon</entidade> then orders Sam to begin writing letters immediately and make sure that all forty-four of <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>'s ravens are well-fed, as every one of them is to fly that night: the <entidade:White Walkers>White Walkers</entidade> have returned, and <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> must be warned.
Stopping to rest and tend to his injuries after fleeing the wildlings, <entidade:Jon Snow>Jon Snow</entidade> finds himself confronted by a furious <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>, who has an arrow ready to shoot him. Jon tries to talk <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> out of shooting him, insisting that he still loves her but that she should have known his loyalty to the Watch was never gone. Though his feelings are clearly reciprocated, <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> is still angered by his betrayal and shoots Jon three times with her bow as he flees from her, watching him go with tears in her eyes.
Jon is badly injured, but his horse manages to carry him the rest of the way to <entidade:<entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade>><entidade:<entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black><entidade:Castle Black>Castle</entidade> Black</entidade></entidade>, as he hovers in and out of consciousness. <entidade:Having>Having</entidade> reached safety, Jon is brought inside the castle by the guards, where he encounters Sam and <entidade:Pypar>Pypar</entidade>, who are overjoyed to see him and insist that his injuries be taken care of.

Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
Outside the walls of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>, Daenerys <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade> and her advisors wait for the city's slaves to appear. Daenerys frets that the <entidade:Yunkish>Yunkish</entidade> slaves, who are better treated than <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>'s might have grown to like their chains and will not welcome freedom. Finally, the gates open and the freedmen pour out. <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade> begins to tell them of how Daenerys the <entidade:Unburnt>Unburnt</entidade> freed them, but Daenerys interrupts and says that it is the slaves' own choice to reach for their freedom. After a moment, one of the freedmen stretches his hand towards Daenerys and calls out "mhysa". After a moment, another follows suit, then another and another until the entire crowd is chanting "mhysa". <entidade:Bewildered>Bewildered</entidade>, Daenerys turns to <entidade:Missandei>Missandei</entidade>, who reveals that the word means "mother" in the <entidade:<entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> Ghiscari>Ghiscari</entidade>><entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> <entidade:<entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> Ghiscari>Ghiscari</entidade></entidade> language. When the slaves advance on Daenerys, the Unsullied step into formation, but the queen tells them to stand down. Telling her dragons to fly, Daenerys steps out of the protection of the Unsullied and into the crowd, who carry on their chanting. Daenerys is embraced by the former slaves, offering a glimmer of hope in an increasingly darker and hopeless world.
