Summary
<entidade:Beyond>Beyond</entidade> the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
    <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> warns <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade>.  <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> SnowÂ is with the group of twenty wildlings under the command of <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade>, who were sent ahead of the main army of King-Beyond-the-Wall <entidade:Mance Rayder>Mance Rayder</entidade> to scale the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and attack <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> from behind. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> are gathering firewood, when the warg <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> asks him about the defenses of the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade>. <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> and he wants to know how frequent they are. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four, two builders to inspect for structural damage and two rangers to protect them, but that the frequency of their patrols often changes. <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> says the wildlings know there are nineteen castles along the south side of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, but he wants to know how many are currently manned. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> finds this very unpleasant, but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned. <entidade:Apart>Apart</entidade> from <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> (which even the wildlings know is manned), there is also Eastwatch-by-the-Sea at the extreme eastern end, and The <entidade:Shadow Tower>Shadow Tower</entidade> at the western end. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is then asked how many men currently garrison <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is very reluctant to answer, but after being threatened by <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade>, he gives an exaggerated number, saying there are one thousand men (this is a lie, as <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade> only had six hundred men before the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> Ranging, and the garrison now is closer to three hundred). <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> tells <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> that he likes him, but if he's lying to them, he'll rip his guts out through his throat.
    <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> is caught off-guard when <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> begins performing oral sex on her.  
<entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> then walk away, but she steals his sword <entidade:Longclaw>Longclaw</entidade>, making him chase her to get it back. She leads him into a nearby cave, which is heated by natural hotsprings, which form a waterfall and a pool. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> starts disrobing, and says that she wants to make sure <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> <entidade:Ramsay Snow>Snow</entidade> has truly come over to the wildlings' side and broken his Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> vows - by making him break his oath of celibacy with her. She quickly shucks off all of her clothes and walks up to him naked. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> is very hesitant to break his vows, and very shy because he's never had sex before. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> questions why he's still dressed, and they start kissing. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> continues to kiss down her body as she insists that he has no experience and therefore "You know nothing, <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> Sn--" but stops mid-word as <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> starts performing oral sex on her.

    <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> taking a bath after sex.  Some time after they finish having sex, they lie together in a naked embrace. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> asks if "that thing you did with your mouth" is what <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lords</entidade> do to their Ladies in the south, but <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> says she just seemed to like it when he kissed her there. He admits he's never had sex with anyone before and is "a maid", though <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> starts listing off some wildling boys she's had sex with before. The first was a boy who also had red hair like her, which is rare among the wildlings and considered very lucky: they call having red hair being "kissed by fire", and another was a Thenn that was "built like an ox", but he could not speak the <entidade:Common Tongue>Common Tongue</entidade>. <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> and <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> then slide into the hot springs pool to take a bath together and romantically cuddle more. <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> tells <entidade:Jon Arryn>Jon</entidade> she wishes they could stay in this cave forever (instead of having to leave and face the winter, wars, and monsters outside).
Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> Slaver's Bay, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> Targaryen's new army of freed <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>, having just sacked <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade>, head north to the next of the three great slaver-cities, <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>. Ser <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah Mormont</entidade> tells Ser <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan Selmy</entidade> how he was knighted at the end of the <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> Rebellion, in which they both fought. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> explains that he was the second man through the breach during the Siege of <entidade:Pyke>Pyke</entidade>, right behind <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> of <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myr</entidade>, who charged in headlong waving about his flaming sword. <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> thinks this is amusing as he wasn't there (he was commanding the Siege of <entidade:Old Nan>Old</entidade> Wyk at the time). <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> himself knighted <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> for his bravery that day, the proudest of Jorah's life, though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight.
<entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> admits that <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> was a good man and a good warrior, but laments that he turned out to be a terrible king. <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> laments that he wasted so much of his life defending kings who didn't deserve it; seventeen years defending <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade>, and the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys Targaryen</entidade> before that. <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> explains that a man of honor must keep his vows no matter what, whether he's serving a drunk or a lunatic (the reason why he never turned on <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> the way <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> ultimately did). <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> says that just once before he dies, he wants to know what it's like to serve with pride, fighting for someone he believes in.
Their talk turns to <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>, and <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> says that <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> can believe in her. <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> says she'll have good men to advise her, though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> at her side when they return to Westeros; <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> admits that he may never be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves, which is abhorred in <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade>, if any of them spoke against <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> when he wanted <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>, the last <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>, assassinated. It becomes apparent that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> is trying to figure out if <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> knew that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> was initially a spy for <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade>, reporting back to <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade>. Jorah's report that <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> was pregnant is what made <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> demand that <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> be assassinated at a <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> meeting with <entidade:Ned Stark>Ned</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> points out that the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> of the <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> traditionally holds a seat on the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade>. However, <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> explains that as a former <entidade:Targaryen Kingsguard>Kingsguard</entidade> member under <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys Targaryen</entidade>, and one who'd killed several of Robert's friends, while <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> didn't mind keeping him in his position as a guard, he never really trusted his advice, so he left him out of <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> meetings. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> is relieved that <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> was therefore not present at any council meeting so he couldn't have learned that <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> was sending it reports on <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>. <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> and <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> briefly bicker about the fact that <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> only just came to them, while <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> was defending <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> from <entidade:Robert Baratheon>Robert</entidade> Baratheon's assassins for months, and <entidade:Barristan Selmy>Barristan</entidade> isn't <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Commander>Commander</entidade> here; <entidade:Jorah Mormont>Jorah</entidade> takes his orders from <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade>.
Meanwhile, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> and her translator/aide-de-camp <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> meet with the assembled officers of the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>. She addresses them in <entidade:Low Valyrian>Low Valyrian</entidade>, and says that now that they are no longer slaves but free men and they can make their own choices, and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>. They part ranks and one of the eunuchs steps forward. She asks him to remove his helmet and tell her his name, and he introduces himself as "Grey Worm". <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is confused, and <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Missandei</entidade> explains that when the slavemasters of <entidade:Astapor>Astapor</entidade> castrate slave-boys to train them as <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade>, they force new slave-names onto them which are intentionally demeaning, usually a combination of a color and a kind of vermin, i.e. "Grey Worm", "Red Flea", "Black Rat", etc. <entidade:This>This</entidade> is to enforce the mentality in the <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> that this is just what they are: worthless, expendable vermin. <entidade:Disgusted>Disgusted</entidade>, <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> issues the command that all <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> must choose their own new names as free men, or reclaim the names their parents gave them. The <entidade:Kraznys Unsullied>Unsullied</entidade> commander says that he will continue to be known as "Grey Worm": his original name is accursed, because it was the name he had when he was taken as a slave, but "Grey Worm" is a lucky name he will bear with pride, because it is the name he had when he was set free by <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> Stormborn of <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Targaryen Conquest>Targaryen</entidade>. <entidade:Missandei Daenerys>Daenerys</entidade> is deeply touched by his loyalty.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade>
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>, the prisoners <entidade:Martyn Lannister>Martyn</entidade> and <entidade:Willem Lannister>Willem Lannister</entidade> (squires fifteen and fourteen years old, respectively) awake to hear shouting and fighting outside the door to their cell. <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> fights his way into the room with some of his own men. Confused, <entidade:Willem Lannister>Willem</entidade> asks if this is a rescue, and is promptly killed by the <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> men. <entidade:Martyn Lannister>Martyn</entidade> begs that he is just a squire and didn't do anything, but <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger, killing him. 

    <entidade:Martyn Lannister>Martyn</entidade> and <entidade:Willem Lannister>Willem</entidade> lie dead before <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>.  
The bloody corpses of the two <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> in Riverrun's main meeting room. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> is disgusted, remarking that <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> needed five men to brutally murder two unarmed squires in their own prison cell. <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> insists that it was a father's vengeance. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of Karstark's sons, who were both killed by <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade>. <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> explains that he was denied his vengeance when Robb's mother <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> set <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>. Finally having enough, <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> did the next best thing, and killed Jaime's kin who they held prisoner. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> angrily shouts that they were only little boys, and <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> can't blame <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war. <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> stands firm, and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go, when in war they should be killing them - if Robb's father ever taught him that. <entidade:Brynden Tully>Brynden</entidade> <entidade:Lysa Tully>Tully</entidade> punches <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> over this remark, but <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> tells him to leave <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> alone. <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> has utterly lost faith in <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>, and says that the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> in the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> will just give him a scolding, though he should probably call him "the <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Who Lost>Who Lost</entidade> the North" after he allowed <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> to fall. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> orders all of Karstark's men hanged, and to hang the lookout last so he can watch the others die. <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> himself is sent to the dungeons.
Robb's uncle <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> <entidade:Lysa Tully>Tully</entidade> insists that if word of this leaves <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews. Therefore, he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys, and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>, however, refuses to be a liar: he says he cannot fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks. All of Robb's advisors tell him this is a bad idea. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> and his wife <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade> warn him that the <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> soldiers will abandon his cause and return home if he executes their lord, and they are already badly outnumbered. <entidade:Catelyn Stark>Catelyn</entidade> says they should keep <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> hostage, and <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> agrees, saying that they can just keep him hostage and tell the other <entidade:Karstarks>Karstarks</entidade> that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal. 

    <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> executes <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade>.  
<entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> ignores their pleas, and he has <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> brought out to the courtyard of <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> to be executed during a driving rainstorm. <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> points out that not only are both of their Houses descended from the <entidade:First Men>First Men</entidade>, but the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> and <entidade:Karstarks>Karstarks</entidade> are kin (as <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> is a cadet branch of <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, founded centuries ago by younger son Karlon Stark). <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> says that their blood relationship did not stop <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> from betraying him and won't stop <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> from executing him now, but <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> says it isn't meant to: he wants it to haunt <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> until the day he dies. With his last words, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade> says that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> will be cursed (as a kinslayer) and that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> is no king of his. <entidade:Obedient>Obedient</entidade> to the laws of his father <entidade:Eddard Stark>Eddard</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Rickard Stark>Rickard</entidade>.
Robb's strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would: the <entidade:Karstarks>Karstarks</entidade> withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home, resulting in <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade>. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> openly admits to <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade> that she was right, and he made a mistake. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> says <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> realizes that he's in such a strong position he doesn't even need to attack the <entidade:Northeners>Northerners</entidade> anymore, he just needs to wait, and let their demoralized forces unravel. When the war began Robb's army was unified around a central purpose, but now they have lost momentum, and his generals are acting like bickering children. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> shows <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade> a war map of the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> - depicting Robb's armies concentrated around <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> and <entidade:Whent of Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> armies overrunning the <entidade:Stormlands>Stormlands</entidade>, Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, and <entidade:Yara Greyjoy>Greyjoy</entidade> forces occupying the western coasts of the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>. <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade> suggests that he try to take the fight to the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> if they won't come to him, but he explains that this is hopeless. Taking King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> would have been difficult to begin with, but now <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> and the bulk of the main <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> army, as well as a large <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> army, are defending the city. Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide, and <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> would crush them within a day. <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade> suggests that he lead his army back to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> to repulse the <entidade:Greyjoys>Greyjoys</entidade> from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back home, they won't want to leave again - particularly because "winter is coming," and the coming one is expected to be very long, five years or more. The <entidade:Northeners>Northerners</entidade> have been away from their farms fighting in the war, however, so they haven't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles. Thus if <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> returns to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the <entidade:Riverlords>Riverlords</entidade> who declared for him. Eyeing the map with <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> decides that if King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> is too strong to attack and he can't return home, his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> decides that with the main <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> army-group under <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> now positioned all the way to the east in King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, he needs to return to the <entidade:Westerlands>Westerlands</entidade> and make an all-or-nothing assault against <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>. <entidade:This>This</entidade> will make the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> lose face, just as <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> did when he lost his home castle of <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, and bring momentum back to his army. However, with the loss of the <entidade:Rickard Karstark>Karstark</entidade> forces, they don't currently have enough men to consider attacking <entidade:Casterly Rock>Casterly Rock</entidade>. The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> can win back the allegiance of <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Frey</entidade>, whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from Robb's army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying <entidade:Talisa Maegyr>Talisa</entidade>, a political nobody, instead of one of the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Black Walder>Walder</entidade> Frey's daughters. Thus, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> must try to repair his alliance with <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Frey</entidade>.

    <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> taunting <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> about his hand.  <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Whent of Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> presents the captive <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> and <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> of <entidade:House Tarth>Tarth</entidade> to the <entidade:Northern Lords>Northern</entidade> castellan, <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade>. <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> is quite proud of himself for his torture of <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, but <entidade:Roose Bolton>Roose</entidade> is surprised that <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> has lost his hand. Oblivious, <entidade:Locke>Locke</entidade> boasts that <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> hasn't "lost" the hand, and points out that he cut it off and hung Jaime's own hand around his neck. <entidade:Angered>Angered</entidade> that LockeÂ maimed such a valuable hostage, <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> demands that he dispose of Jaime's rotting hand, and orders that accommodations be provided for the pair of prisoners. When <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> asks if there is news from the capital, <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> informs him that <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> laid siege to the city in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>... then needlessly drags out revealing the result. <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> toys with <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> but remains completely calm, never even grinning, before finally revealing that his sister <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is alive and well, and his father's forces successfully repulsed Stannis's assault. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses. <entidade:House Bolton>Bolton</entidade> calls for <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> to attend to Jaime's injuries. <entidade:Later>Later</entidade>, <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> peels away the crude tourniquet that Locke's men applied to <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> asks if he will die, and <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> says he won't, but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder. Half-delirious from the infection, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> refuses, and says he'll kill <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> if he tries. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then notices that <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> is not a <entidade:Order of Maesters>Maester</entidade>, because he isn't wearing a maester's chain of office. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> acknowledges this, explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the <entidade:Citadel>Citadel</entidade> and thrown out of the <entidade:Order of Maesters>Order of Maesters</entidade>, because as he says, he was conducting experiments which they felt were "too bold." <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> gets ready to cut <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, and says he'll at least try to save his elbow, but with a sudden burst of effort <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> grabs him around the throat with his left hand, and says he doesn't need his right hand to kill him. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> relents, and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten, then burning out the wounds with boiling wine, and with luck this might be able to stop the infection without having to amputate more of Jaime's arm above the wrist. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> says he's willing to try this, but <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> cautions that it will cause a great amount of pain so he needs to give him <entidade:Milk>Milk</entidade> of the <entidade:Poppy>Poppy</entidade>, but <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> refuses to take it, and says he'll just scream. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain, but <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> says that he will just scream loudly. <entidade:Qyburn>Qyburn</entidade> begins to dig into the stump of Jaime's arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue, and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> howls in agony.
Some time later, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> is in Harrenhal's bathhouse, scrubbing off weeks' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant, barely able to stand due to the pain he is in. He asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then walks naked into the same communal bath that <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> is in, on the far side. She is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths, but he says he wants this one; he's afraid he's going to pass out at any moment, and wants her to save him from drowning if he does, because he doesn't want to be the first <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> to die in a bathtub. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> asks why she should care how he dies, but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade> in one piece - which (indicating the stump of his hand) has not been going so well. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> quips that it's no wonder <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> died with <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> guarding him, at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath, facing him fully nude, to show him she isn't afraid of him. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> gravely says that was "unworthy" and asks for forgiveness, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> angrily orders him not to mock her, but he insists he's seriously apologizing. <entidade:Exhausted>Exhausted</entidade>, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> says he's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce; <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> says you need trust to have a truce, but he says he trusts her, so she sits back down.

    <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> recounts Aerys's madness.  <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then notes that <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> has the same look on her face that he's seen on countless faces in the past seventeen years: people that despise him, call him "kingslayer" more than his own name, or "oathbreaker" and "a man without honor." <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> then goes on to recall the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> King'sÂ obsession with wildfire, how <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> enjoyed watching people being burned alive. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> recalls <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> burned lords he didn't like, HandsÂ who failed him, and anyone he thought was against him. Ultimately, half of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade> rebelled against him, so <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> had his pyromancers place caches of wildfire all over King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>: under the <entidade:Great Hall>Great</entidade> <entidade:Septa Unella>Sept</entidade> of <entidade:Baelor>Baelor</entidade>, under the slums of <entidade:Flea Bottom>Flea Bottom</entidade>, under houses, stables, taverns, and even under the <entidade:Red Keep>Red Keep</entidade> itself. After Robert'sÂ victory at the <entidade:River Trident>Trident</entidade> he marched on the capital city, but Jaime's father <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> arrived there first, leading the entire <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> army, and promising to defend the city. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> warned <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> that his father was never a man to choose the losing side, that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could, but the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> refused to listen. <entidade:North Edit>Nor</entidade> did <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> listen to <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> when he gave the same warning that <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> couldn't be trusted - but he did listen to Grand <entidade:Order of Maesters>Maester</entidade> <entidade:Grand Pycelle>Pycelle</entidade>, who convinced <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> were there to help. <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> opened the city gates, and the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> proceeded to sack the city.Â Jaime again begged <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> to surrender, but the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> ordered <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> to bring him Tywin's head, and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze, burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> makes it plain to <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade> commanded her to kill her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people; she can only sit in shocked silence. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer first, then drove his sword into Aerys's back as the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> tried to run for his life. <entidade:Shaken>Shaken</entidade> at the memory, <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> speculates that <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> didn't believe he would die in the blaze; in his lunacy, the <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the fire, granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes... so <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> finished <entidade:Aerys Targaryen>Aerys</entidade> off by slitting his throat in order toÂ make sure he died, concluding thatÂ Eddard StarkÂ found him at that point.
Stunned, <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> asks why <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> didn't defend himself with this account before. <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> angrily rants that the "honorable" <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> would never have believed a word he said: <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> didn't want to hear Jaime's side of the story when he'd already judged him guilty.     <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> faints.  <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade> goes on to rage, yelling what right <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> had to judge him, by what right the wolf dares to judge the lion. The strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>, however, and he begins to faint, nearly falling face-first into the water. <entidade:Brienne>Brienne</entidade> catches him and calls for help for the <entidade:Kingslayer>Kingslayer</entidade>, at which (as he slips out of consciousness) he whimpers to himself "Jaime. <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>My</entidade> name is <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>..."
    The <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> vs <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade>.  
Elsewhere in the <entidade:Riverlands>Riverlands</entidade>, at the hideout of the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> Without <entidade:Banners>Banners</entidade> in <entidade:Hollow Hill>Hollow Hill</entidade>, <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor Clegane</entidade> prepares to fight <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric Dondarrion</entidade> in a trial by combat. As both men prepare, <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> of <entidade:Myrcella Baratheon>Myr</entidade> prays to the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> to judge <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent. Before the fight begins, <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> calls upon the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> to ignite his sword with flame, using only his blood. Due to the Sandor's fear of fire, <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> initially has an advantage against the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade>. <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> even manages to set Sandor's wooden shield on fire, which is strapped so tightly to Sandor's arm that he cannot remove it and is nearly burned himself. Eventually, however, Sandor's raw physical strength and anger (born of terror) overpowers <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade>, and with a single downward swipe, cuts right through his flaming sword, his armor, and deep into his shoulder, killing him.

    <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> reviving <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade>.  
As <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> falls to the ground,Â Thoros quickly rushes to his side, and begins praying to the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> to revive him. <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> grabs a dagger and attempts to kill the <entidade:Hound Clegane>Hound</entidade> while he is down, but she is stopped by <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade>. As she curses him, <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> taunts <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> over how the god prefers him over her dead friend, however they are both interrupted by <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade>, who has been revived by the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of Light's power. <entidade:Having>Having</entidade> won the trial, and proven his innocence in the eyes of god, <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> is allowed to leave. The <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> had taken all of the gold <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> had on him (to fund their cause), and in lieu of returning it, <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war. <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> scoffs at this and throws it to the ground, but <entidade:Anguy>Anguy</entidade> says he should be thankful they're letting him leave with his life. <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Clegane</entidade> is hooded so he won't know the way back to their hideout, then led away to be released some distance away.
After the fight, <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> works on repairing Beric's armor, and <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> questions why, because they will be leaving soon. <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> Without <entidade:Banners>Banners</entidade>, to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> says that their plan was to find her brother <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade>, and <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> needs soldiers too, but <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> points out that he has no attachments to <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>: <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> would be going to her noble-born family, and he'd just be serving another lord. <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> says he's been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it: he worked most of his life for <entidade:Tobho Mott>Tobho Mott</entidade> and he repaid <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> by selling him to the Night's <entidade:Night Watch>Watch</entidade> (as soon as the secret payments from <entidade:Varys>Varys</entidade> ended), and he "served" <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin Lannister</entidade> as a prisoner at <entidade:Whent of Harrenhal>Harrenhal</entidade>, every day afraid he'd be killed or tortured. He'd be serving in the <entidade:Brotherhood>Brotherhood</entidade> too, but they chose <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> as their leader, and they're more like a family - and as a common-born tavern maiden's son who was orphaned at a young age, <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> has never had a family. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> sadly chokes out that she could be his family. <entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> response, <entidade:Gendry>Gendry</entidade> politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her, they'd never be family: he'd still be a commoner, and she'd be "m'lady."
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night, <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer-list for the death of her enemies. <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> says that they plan to bring her to <entidade:Riverrun>Riverrun</entidade> to reunite her with her family, and in exchange for a reward from <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> to fund their cause. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> points out that they are ransoming her, and <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> admits they technically are, but this is different. They do intend to escort her safely through the war-ravaged countryside to her family, and <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> would like to return her for free out of memory of her father, but they really need the gold to support themselves. <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> says he knows she must be angry with him, but releasing <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> was the right thing to do, as they'd promised to let him go free if he won the trial by combat. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> is still quietly upset, as she's now seen many honorable men keep their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it (such as <entidade:Yoren>Yoren</entidade> and her own father). She wonders why <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> would want to let <entidade:Sandor Clegane>Sandor</entidade> go when he nearly killed him, but <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> insists that he did actually kill him. When <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> asks how, <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> points her to <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> to explain, but he says that he isn't the one who brings <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> back to life, it's the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>, and <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> is just the "lucky drunk" who recites the prayers. <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso: they explain that <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now, counting his recent death in the trial by combat. He has been impaled on a lance, shot with an arrow, and at his fifth death the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye (which didn't heal when <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> brought him back). <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> earnestly asks <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> if he could bring back to life a man without a head. <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> and <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father, but <entidade:Thoros of Myr>Thoros</entidade> says he doesn't think it works that way (both because he was decapitated, and because he's been dead for far too long by now). <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> consoles her that her father was a good man, but he wouldn't wish his resurrected life on him. <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> explains that being brought back from the dead carries a heavy toll, as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> still says she would wish Beric's life on her father, because at least <entidade:Beric Dondarrion>Beric</entidade> is still alive.

<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade> is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>, and doesn't have the daily support of the <entidade:Red Priestess>Red Priestess</entidade> <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> since she left on what she claimed was an important mission. Most of Stannis' army has been destroyed, and the only reason the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> haven't attacked <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade> yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade> that they cannot yet mount an amphibious assault. With little else to do, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> takes the time to visit his wife, <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> (who was born into <entidade:House Tyrell>House</entidade> Florent), for the first time since returning from the battle. He finds her in her chamber, praying over a fire to the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>: <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> is a fanatical believer in the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> religion, far more so than <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, and it was indeed <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> who first invited <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> to <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> and <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> do not have a loving relationship, but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the Lord's <entidade:Chosen>Chosen</entidade>. She tells him not to despair despite his defeat, and he will be victorious, but he laments that he used to believe that once. Due to his extreme belief in duty, (unlike his hedonistic brother Robert) <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade>, when he had sex with <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed <entidade:Renly Baratheon>Renly</entidade>. He begins to confess to <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> that he has sinned and shamed her, but she interrupts him and says <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> can be a sin. Indeed, she wept for joy when <entidade:Melisandre>Melisandre</entidade> told her of this service she did for the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade> with <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade>, and because the <entidade:Red Priestess>Red Priestess</entidade> gave him a "son" (of sorts) which she never could. Stannis' face is filled with a mix of shock, disgust, and relief. <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> had three sons with <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> but they were all stillborn, and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars. The deaths of her "sweet boys" and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade>, and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the <entidade:Dornish Lords>Lord</entidade> of <entidade:Light>Light</entidade>. She weeps, and laments that she has given <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> nothing - he does not blame her, and with pity he says that's not true. <entidade:Selyse Baratheon>Selyse</entidade> understands he is referring to their daughter and only child, Princess <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Baratheon</entidade>. She grows annoyed when she realizes he's come to see her too, and says he shouldn't waste time on such distractions, but insists that she is his daughter, and she relents because it is not her place to question her king.    <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> visits <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> while in the dungeons.  
<entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the sea to herself, and is excited to see her father. She is a cheerful but sickly young girl (about the same age as <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark), with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded <entidade:Shireen Greyscale>Greyscale</entidade> disease. <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> wanted to see his daughter, but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her. She says she heard he was in a battle and asks if he won, and he good-naturedly says no. <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> is slightly let-down, but asks if the <entidade:Onion Knight>Onion Knight</entidade> came back as well: Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos Seaworth</entidade> has been her friend during his service to her father, and he even made her a toy ship. Growing tense over their falling out, <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> briefly explains that Ser <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon. Confused, he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind.
<entidade:Later>Later</entidade> that night, <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> sneaks down to the dungeon of <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade> and finds the cell of "Ser <entidade:Onion Knight>Onion Knight</entidade>." He wakes up and tells her she shouldn't be there, but she explains that the fat guard <entidade:Bert>Bert</entidade> is on duty, who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his watch. She asks if it is true that he is a traitor, and he says that it is, as he disobeyed her father. She says she doesn't care, he's her friend. She was worried that he must get bored down in his cell, so she brought him a book to read, about <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> the <entidade:Conquer>Conquer</entidade> and his dragons - she excitedly points out that the <entidade:Targaryens>Targaryens</entidade> built <entidade:Dragonstone>Dragonstone</entidade>, and <entidade:Aegon Targaryen>Aegon</entidade> used to live in this very castle. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> reluctantly explains that it's wasted on him, because he doesn't know how to read. <entidade:Undaunted>Undaunted</entidade>, <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> offers to teach him how to read, by coming down to his cell and reading to him when <entidade:Bert>Bert</entidade> is on duty. <entidade:Davos Seaworth>Davos</entidade> chides her that they can't, but she asks what's the worst the guards could do to them if they find out, lock them in cells? They have a quiet laugh, and <entidade:Shireen Baratheon>Shireen</entidade> starts to read to <entidade:Davos An History of Aegon>Davos An History of Aegon</entidade> the <entidade:Conquer>Conqueror</entidade> and His Conquest of <entidade:Westeros>Westeros</entidade>.
<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> King's <entidade:Landing>Landing</entidade>, <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Regent>Regent</entidade> <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei Lannister</entidade> encounters <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Petyr</entidade> "Littlefinger" <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> in a courtyard, and tells him she fears that the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> do not have the Lannisters' best interests at heart, but her father won't listen. Therefore, she asks that <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> use his spies to try to find out what they're up to, because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the Lannister-Tyrell alliance. He agrees, but <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade>, but the girl could not be found.

<entidade:Crossroads Inn>In</entidade> the castle gardens, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> watch her brother Ser LorasÂ spar with his squire. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> confidently remarks on his fighting ability, and inquires when she and <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> will wed, as per the <entidade:House Tyrell>Tyrell</entidade> plot to keep her out of the hands of <entidade:Petyr Baelish>Baelish</entidade> and/or the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade>. <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> replies that she will "plant the seed" of the idea after she and <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> are married. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is skeptical <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> will let her go but <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Margaery</entidade> is confident he will do it to please her, once she is his wife. After the match, Ser Loras' new squire <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> flirts with him, which leads to them having sex back in Loras' chambers. As they finish, <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> mentions that he is engaged to be married... a fact that <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade> passes on to his real master, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade>, so he can pass the information on to <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade>.    <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> and <entidade:Olyvar Frey>Olyvar</entidade>  
A short time later, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> meets with <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade>, offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the <entidade:Vale>Vale</entidade> of <entidade:Jon Arryn>Arryn</entidade>. <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> practices lying for a change, and tells him that they should wait until after Joffrey's wedding, primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails. A master manipulator, <entidade:Littlefinger>Littlefinger</entidade> is clearly suspicious of her motives, but doesn't press the matter for the moment. Instead he says he is touched by her concern for his safety, and insists that she call him "Petyr."
<entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> the same time, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion Lannister</entidade> is engaged in a meeting with <entidade:Lady>Lady</entidade> <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> Tyrell; with the upcoming royal wedding shaping up to be an extravagant and expensive affair, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is concerned about the cost. <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> points out that the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> have done much to supply the city with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort, as well as the coming winter. <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade> is bored to discuss financial matters, but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> are supplying to aid the crown, demonstrating that <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> doesn't need to lecture her about wartime expenses. She insists that the royal wedding must go on as planned, as it will do much to improve the city's morale and keep the people happy, otherwise they will start blaming the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> for the war again. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> cannot outmaneuver <entidade:Olenna Tyrell>Olenna</entidade>, but in the end she decides on her own that she won't have it said <entidade:House Tyrell>House Tyrell</entidade> isn't doing its part to help, so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities, for which <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> is grateful.
<entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> heads to the <entidade:Small Council>Small Council</entidade> chamber to report success to his father <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade>, only to find <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> present as well, much to his annoyance. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> explains that the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> are plotting to wed <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> to Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> and states that he will not allow them to steal "the key to the north" out from under him. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> questions how <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is the key to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, given that her older brother is still alive. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> explains that the desertion of the <entidade:Karstarks>Karstarks</entidade> have cost <entidade:Sansa Robb>Robb</entidade> <entidade:Benjen Stark>Stark</entidade> half his army, and (combined with already being badly outnumbered by the Lannister-Tyrell alliance) his days are now numbered. Theon GreyjoyÂ murdered Robb's younger brothers at <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade>, which makes <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> Robb's heir: if he dies, rule of <entidade:Winter>Winterfell</entidade> and the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> goes to her and any man she marries... which <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> has no intention of letting the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> get their hands on. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match, but <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> points out that as a plot against them, the Tyrells' plan is, by definition, a secret, thus the <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> can't be said to be "refusing" them something which they aren't officially trying to do. He also notes that the <entidade:Tyrells Margaery>Tyrells</entidade> won't go through with their plan until after Joffrey's wedding, which means they need to act first... namely by finding <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> another husband.

After a moment, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> realizes from the comments of his father and sister that they are talking about him. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> tries to protest, pointing out that <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> has made Sansa's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> on her after she has finally escaped <entidade:Joffrey Baratheon>Joffrey</entidade> is cruel, even by Tywin's standards. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> questions if <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> plans to mistreat <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl's happiness and neither should his son. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> protests that <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is a child, but <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> counters she has flowered and is a woman now who can bear children. <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> flatly refuses, but <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> points out that recently he was complaining that he wasn't rewarded for his actions in the <entidade:Battle>Battle</entidade> of the <entidade:Blackwater Bay>Blackwater</entidade>, and as heiress to the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade>, <entidade:Sansa Robb>Sansa</entidade> is a far better reward than he could expect, and in any case, it is long past time <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> was wed. <entidade:At Karl>At</entidade> this, <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> snarls that he was wed, referring to his past marriage to <entidade:Tysha>Tysha</entidade>, asking if his father has forgotten that. Returning his son's hateful glare with one of his own, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> retorts that he remembers all too well.    <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> arranges some marriages.  
<entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> gloats over the matter, but her smug attitude quickly evaporates when her father commands that she will wed Ser <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> instead. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> flatly refuses, but <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> is insistent: the marriages of <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> and <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> will place the <entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> and the <entidade:Reach>Reach</entidade> firmly in the Lannisters' control. <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> points out that <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> is still fertile: she needs to marry and "breed." When <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> protests she is <entidade:Dragon Queen>Queen</entidade> <entidade:Regent>Regent</entidade> and not a brood mare, <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told: she will marry <entidade:Loras Tyrell>Loras</entidade> and in so doing, put an end to what <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> calls "the disgusting rumors" <entidade:Stannis Baratheon>Stannis</entidade> has been spreading about her and <entidade:Jaime Lannister>Jaime</entidade>. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> switches to earnestly begging him, calling him "father" and pleading that he not force her into an arranged marriage a second time (after her long and loveless marriage with <entidade:Balon King>King</entidade> Robert). <entidade:Tywin Lannister>Tywin</entidade> refuses to listen and storms out in disgust, raging that the pair have disgraced the <entidade:Willem Lannister>Lannister</entidade> name for far too long. <entidade:Cersei Lannister>Cersei</entidade> slowly shifts her gaze toward <entidade:Tyrion Lannister>Tyrion</entidade> to gauge his reaction to her distress but sees he is too glum about his own predicament.
