Jon faces his harshest test yet. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> discovers a new gift. Daario and Jorah debate how to take <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>. <entidade:House Frey>House Frey</entidade> joins with <entidade:House <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade>>House <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade></entidade>.

Summary
Across the <entidade:Narrow Sea>Narrow Sea</entidade>
<entidade:Outside>Outside</entidade> the walls of <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>, <entidade:Daenerys Targaryen>Daenerys Targaryen</entidade> and her commanders plan an attack on the city. Her newest captain, <entidade:Daario Naharis>Daario Naharis</entidade>, suggests a plan using a lightly defended back gate, a small group can infiltrate the city and open the main gates for the rest of the army to invade. Though Jorah <entidade:Commander Mormont>Mormont</entidade> is skeptical of both the plan and Daario's loyalty, Daenerys is convinced to try it when she asks <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> if he trusts Daario. Upon being encouraged to speak his mind, he says he does. Daario also touches her on her hand, flirting for her favor to him. As the captains depart, <entidade:Ser Barristan>Ser Barristan</entidade> asks to go along, but Jorah reminds him that a <entidade:Queensguard>Queensguard</entidade>'s place is at the Queen's side, regardless of his pride.
That night <entidade:Ser Jorah>Ser Jorah</entidade>, Daario, and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> sneak into the city and fight their way through the slave soldiers guarding <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>. There are far more soldiers than Daario anticipated, much to Jorah's irritation, but it seems that the three are evenly matched - barely.
A few hours later, an impatient Daenerys paces in her tent, asking Barristan how long a sacking of a city usually takes. Jorah and <entidade:Grey Worm>Grey Worm</entidade> finally enter, covered in dust and gore but grinning widely: <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade> is defeated. Daenerys is elated, but asks after Daario, who is still absent. After a suspenseful pause by Jorah, Daario strides into the room and kneels before the Queen. He presents <entidade:Yunkai>Yunkai</entidade>'s torn flag and triumphantly says the city is hers.

At the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>
<entidade:North Edit>North</entidade> of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, <entidade:Samwell Tarly>Samwell Tarly</entidade> and <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> continue their march south, after barely escaping an encounter with a <entidade:White Rat>White</entidade> Walker during which Sam actually managed to kill the creature using a dragonglass dagger. 

    Sam tells <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> about a way to get through the wall.  
Sam tells <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> that they are a considerable distance west of <entidade:Castle Black>Castle Black</entidade>, but this isn't a problem, because this means they are close to the <entidade:Nightfort>Nightfort</entidade>, the original headquarters of the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, which was abandoned centuries ago as the organization's numbers dwindled. Sam explains that he plans to get them across the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> using a secret sally-port which leads right into the <entidade:Nightfort>Nightfort</entidade>. <entidade:Gilly>Gilly</entidade> is amazed that Sam knows so much history just from reading books, insisting that he is a wizard (much to <entidade:Sam's>Sam's</entidade> delight) and is awestruck when she finally catches a glimpse of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>.
Meanwhile, <entidade:<entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark><entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> Stark</entidade> and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the <entidade:Seven Kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</entidade> proper, and entered into the <entidade:Gift>Gift</entidade>: a stretch of land south of the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> which was gifted to the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> thousands of years ago by <entidade:Brandon>Brandon</entidade> the Builder, from which the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> draws support for its material needs. The <entidade:Reeds>Reeds</entidade> are puzzled, because the <entidade:Gift>Gift</entidade> possesses good arable land but the countryside is empty. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> explains, to <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade>'s discomfort, that wildling attacks coming over or around the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> caused most of the smallfolk to flee the <entidade:Gift>Gift</entidade> over the centuries. Meanwhile, the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>'s diminishing numbers mean they don't really need that much support from the <entidade:Gift>Gift</entidade> anymore, explaining why they haven't encountered any brothers of the <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> working the lands either. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade>'s group takes shelter in an abandoned mill to get out of a thunderstorm.
Nearby in the <entidade:Gift>Gift</entidade>, <entidade:Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade>>Jon <entidade:Jon Snow>Snow</entidade></entidade> and the wildling party encounter an old man who lives alone at a small farm where he breeds horses for the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>. They plan to attack him to steal his horses and gold, but Jon insists that the old man is no threat to them. <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> and <entidade:<entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane><entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> Giantsbane</entidade> intend to kill the man so as to stop him from alerting the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade> to their presence. However, when the party attacks the farmstead, Jon surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword, alerting the old man who flees; Jon also distracts <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade>  when she tries to shoot the fleeing man with an arrow. While in the mill, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> and <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> <entidade:House Reed>Reed</entidade> discuss how they plan to cross the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>, before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby. After the old man is captured by the wildlings, Hodor — scared by the thunder — begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and cause him to pass out.

    <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> attacks a <entidade:Wildling>Wildling</entidade>.  
<entidade:Outside>Outside</entidade>, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> moves to kill the old man, but <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is ultimately unable to kill the innocent man, and instead <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> kills the man with an arrow. Realizing that Jon is still loyal to the <entidade:Night King>Night</entidade>'s <entidade:Nights Watch>Watch</entidade>, <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> orders his men to kill Jon; <entidade:Tormund Giantsbane>Tormund</entidade> restrains <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> to stop her trying to help Jon, and soon after Jon battles with <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade>. At the urging of <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade>, <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> enters the mind of <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade>, his direwolf, to aid Jon. <entidade:Summer Isles>Summer</entidade> and <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade> kill two wildlings threatening Jon as he battles to the death with <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> and finally kills him. With the last of his strength <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade> wargs into the mind of his pet eagle, which swoops down and attacks Jon, clawing him badly about the face before he beats the bird off. Jon then jumps to mount a nearby horse and escapes, leaving <entidade:Ygritte>Ygritte</entidade> and heading back to the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade>. 

    Jon kills <entidade:Orell>Orell</entidade>.  
That night <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> asks <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> to take <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> (who would be heir to <entidade:Winterfell>Winterfell</entidade> if anything were to happen to <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> or Robb) to Last <entidade:Hearth>Hearth</entidade>, the home of <entidade:House <entidade:House Umber>Umber</entidade>>House <entidade:House Umber>Umber</entidade></entidade>, while he, Meera and <entidade:Jojen Reed>Jojen</entidade> head through the <entidade:Wall>Wall</entidade> in search of the <entidade:Three-eyed Raven>Three-eyed</entidade> raven. <entidade:Osha –>Osha</entidade> promises to look after <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade> and orders the <entidade:House Reed>Reed</entidade> siblings to do the same with <entidade:Bran Stark>Bran</entidade> before she, <entidade:Rickon Stark>Rickon</entidade>, and <entidade:Shaggydog>Shaggydog</entidade> depart in the dead of night.

At the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>
<entidade:Robb Stark>Robb Stark</entidade>'s army arrives at the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade>, the castle seat of <entidade:House Frey>House Frey</entidade>, for his uncle <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade>'s wedding. Enduring Lord <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade>'s insults directed at him and his wife, Robb makes a public apology to <entidade:Lord Frey>Lord Frey</entidade>'s daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them. Frey accepts the apology and offers the <entidade:Starks>Starks</entidade> and their men his hospitality.
That night <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> is introduced to his bride <entidade:Roslin Frey>Roslin Frey</entidade>, discovering much to his relief that she is a beauty. The wedding and the feast that follows it are quite celebratory and lively affairs, with all the participants in high spirits. 

    <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> and his new bride.  
<entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade> is clearly in love and his attentions are focused solely on his bride. As the celebrations reach their heights <entidade:Lord Walder>Lord Walder</entidade> calls for the bedding ceremony. Robb agrees and the bride and groom are carried off to their wedding bed, Roslin carried off by the male guests and followed closely by <entidade:Edmure Tully>Edmure</entidade>, who is collected by the Frey women. <entidade:Brynden Tully>Brynden</entidade> <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade>, having drunk too much wine, excuses himself from the celebration to "find a tree to piss on."
After they leave and the festivities begin to wind down, Catelyn becomes suspicious when she notices <entidade:Black Walder>Black Walder</entidade> Rivers close the banquet hall doors and the musicians in the gallery begin playing "The <entidade:Rains of Castamere>Rains of Castamere</entidade>" – the song commemorating <entidade:House Lannister>House Lannister</entidade>'s decisive and brutal victory against the rebellious <entidade:House Reyne of Castamere>House Reyne of Castamere</entidade> years ago. Walder rises to make a toast to Robb, and Catelyn, seated beside Lord Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, notices that the latter is wearing mail under his clothing. Realizing they are in a trap, Catelyn slaps Roose across the face and screams a warning to Robb, but by then it is too late. <entidade:Lord Walder>Lord Walder</entidade> signals his men to attack. 

    <entidade:Queen Talisa>Talisa</entidade> is stabbed by <entidade:Lame <entidade:Lame Lothar>Lothar</entidade>>Lame <entidade:Lame Lothar>Lothar</entidade></entidade>.  
In what becomes known as the infamous <entidade:Red Wedding>Red Wedding</entidade>, <entidade:Lame Lothar>Lothar</entidade> draws a knife and repeatedly stabs the pregnant <entidade:Queen Talisa>Talisa</entidade> in the stomach, killing her unborn child. <entidade:Queen Talisa>Talisa</entidade> collapses to the ground as chaos surrounds. Before he can react, Robb is shot by the musicians with crossbows several times and falls to the ground. Numerous other Stark men are killed by the crossbow bolts or set upon by Frey soldiers. Catelyn is shot by one of the musicians in the back and falls to the ground.
<entidade:Outside>Outside</entidade>, <entidade:<entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark><entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> Stark</entidade> and the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>, having arrived at the <entidade:Twins>Twins</entidade> in disguise, are turned away by Frey guards at the time the massacre begins. <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> gives Sandor the slip and sneaks past the gate guards, only to witness Frey men kill Stark soldiers and <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade>, Robb's direwolf. She makes a desperate run for the castle, but is stopped by the <entidade:Hound>Hound</entidade>, who tells her that it is too late. When <entidade:Arya Stark>Arya</entidade> won't stop, Sandor knocks her unconscious before carrying her out of the castle to safety.

    <entidade:Grey Wind>Grey Wind</entidade> is shot dead by Frey crossbowman.  
A wounded Catelyn crawls to safety beneath a table as Walder motions the soldiers to cease. Walder mocks Robb as he limps to his dying wife. He holds <entidade:Queen Talisa>Talisa</entidade> in his arms as she dies. Catelyn sees an opportunity and limps out from under the table to seize out from under <entidade:Walder's>Walder's</entidade> table his cowering young wife, <entidade:Lady Joyeuse>Joyeuse</entidade>. Catelyn holds a knife to the girl's throat and threatens to kill her if Walder does not negotiate an end to the attack. Walder refuses her, recalling the previous betrayed oath made that Robb would marry his daughter. She begs they take her hostage and that Robb, who merely lingers despondent and heartbroken beside his wife's corpse, be allowed to leave. 

    Catelyn kills <entidade:Walder Frey>Walder Frey</entidade>'s wife, the <entidade:Lady <entidade:Lady Joyeuse>Joyeuse</entidade>>Lady <entidade:Lady Joyeuse>Joyeuse</entidade></entidade>, moments before being killed herself.  
He questions why he should agree to such terms to which Catelyn responds by swearing on her honor as both a <entidade:House Tully>Tully</entidade> and a Stark that if he does not let Robb go she will kill his wife. Walder chuckles and nonchalantly responds, "I'll find another." Robb stands and utters, "<entidade:Queen Mother>Mother</entidade>" as ​Roose <entidade:<entidade:Lord Bolton>Lord Bolton</entidade>'s>Bolton</entidade>, who had fled the hall when the massacre began, seizes Robb, whispering "The <entidade:Lannisters>Lannisters</entidade> send their regards," before stabbing him in the heart. Robb maintains eye contact with Catelyn as he collapses to the floor. <entidade:Mad King>Mad</entidade> with grief at the death of her firstborn son, Catelyn cries out in anguish and kills <entidade:Walder's>Walder's</entidade> wife, fulfilling her promise. Now catatonic with grief, she stands there and accepts her fate, allowing <entidade:Black Walder>Black Walder</entidade> to slip up behind her and viciously cut her throat. She falls to the floor with a thud.
